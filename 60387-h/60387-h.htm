<p><span class="firstword">Important</span> as the battle of Baylen was in its
direct and immediate consequences to the Spaniards,
their cause derived greater celebrity and
more permanent strength from the defence of
Zaragoza.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations at Zaragoza.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Order had been restored in that city from
the hour when Palafox assumed the command.
Implicit confidence in the commander produced
implicit and alert obedience, and preparations
were made with zeal and activity proportioned
to the danger. When the new Captain-General
declared war against the French, the troops
which he mustered amounted only to 220 men,
and the public treasury could furnish him with
no more than an hundred dollars; sixteen ill-mounted
guns were all the artillery in the place,
and the arsenal contained but few muskets.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
Fowling-pieces were put in requisition, pikes
were forged, powder was supplied from the mills
at Villafeliche, which were some of the most
considerable in Spain, ... for every thing else Palafox
trusted to his country and his cause. And
his trust was not in vain; the Zaragozans were
ready to endure any suffering and make any
sacrifice in the discharge of their duty; the same
spirit possessed the whole country, and from all
those parts of Spain which were under the yoke
of the enemy officers and soldiers repaired to
Zaragoza as soon as it was seen that an army was
collecting there; many came from Madrid and
from Pampluna, and some officers of engineers
from the military academy at Alcala. And the
spirits of the people were encouraged by the
discovery of a depôt of fire-arms walled up in
the Aljafaria; they had probably been secreted
there in the succession war, when one party resigned
that city to its enemies, and their discovery
in this time of need was regarded by the
Zaragozans as a manifestation of divine Providence
in their favour. The defeats which their
undisciplined levies sustained at Tudela, Mallen,
and Alagon abated not their resolution; and in
the last of these actions a handful of regular
troops protected their retreat with great steadiness.
The French general, Lefebvre Desnouettes,
pursuing his hitherto uninterrupted success,
advanced, and took up a position very near
the city, and covered by a rising ground planted
with olive trees.</p>

wall which surrounded it was from ten to twelve
feet high, and three feet thick, and in many
places it was interrupted by houses, which formed
part of the inclosure. The city had no advantages
of situation for its defence, and would
not have been considered capable of resistance
by any men but those whose courage was sustained
by a virtuous and holy principle of duty.
It stands in an open plain, which was then
covered with olive grounds, and is bounded on
either hand by high and distant mountains; but
it is commanded by some high ground called the
Torrero, about a mile to the south-west, upon
which there was a convent, with some smaller
buildings. The canal of Aragon divides this
elevation from another rising ground, where the
Spaniards had erected a battery. The Ebro
bathes the walls of the city, and separates it from
the suburbs; it has two bridges, within musket-shot
of each other; one of wood, said to be more
beautiful than any other of the like materials in
Europe; the other of freestone, consisting of
seven arches, the largest of which is 122 feet in
diameter; the river is fordable above the city.
Two smaller rivers, the Galego and the Guerva,
flow at a little distance from the city, the one on
the east, the other on the west; the latter being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
separated from the walls only by the breadth of the
common road: both are received into the Ebro.
Unlike most other places of the peninsula, Zaragoza
has neither aqueduct nor fountains, but
derives its water wholly from the river. The
people of Tortosa, (and probably of the other
towns upon its course,) drink also of the Ebro,
preferring it to the finest spring; the water is of
a dirty red colour, but, having stood a few hours,
it becomes perfectly clear, and has a softness
and pleasantness of taste, which soon induces
strangers to agree with the natives in their preference
of it. The population was stated in the
census of 1787 at 42,600; that of 1797, excellent
as it is in all other respects, has the fault of not
specifying the places in each district; later accounts
computed its inhabitants at 60,000, and
it was certainly one of the largest cities in the
peninsula. It had twelve gates, four of them
in the old wall of Augustus, by whom the older
town of Salduba upon the same site was enlarged,
beautified, and called Cæsarea-Augusta,
or Cæsaraugusta; a word easily corrupted into
its<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>present name.</p>

<p>The whole city is built of brick; even the convents
and churches were of this coarse material,
which was bad of its kind, so that there were
cracks in most of these edifices from top to
bottom. The houses are not so high as they
usually are in old Spanish towns, their general<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
height being only three stories; the streets are,
as usual, very narrow and crooked; there are,
however, open market-places; and one very
wide, long, and regularly built street, formerly
called the Calle Santa, having been the scene
of many martyrdoms, but now more commonly
known by the name of the Cozo. The people,
like the rest of the Aragonese, and their neighbours,
the Catalans, have been always honourably
distinguished in Spanish history for their love of
liberty; and the many unavailing struggles which
they have made during the last four centuries,
had not abated their attachment to the good principles
of their forefathers. Within the peninsula,
(and once indeed throughout the whole of Catholic
Europe,) Zaragoza was famous as the city
of our Lady of the Pillar, whose legend is still
so firmly believed by the people, and most of the
clergy in Spain, that it was frequently appealed
to in the proclamations of the different generals
and Juntas, as one of the most popular articles
of the national faith. The legend is this: when

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Our Lady of the Pillar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the apostles, after the resurrection, separated and
went to preach the gospel in different parts of
the world, St. James the elder, (or Santiago, as
he may more properly be called in his mythological
history,) departed for Spain, which province
Christ himself had previously commended
to his care. When he went to kiss the hand of
the Virgin, and request her leave to set off, and
her blessing, she commanded him, in the name
of her Son, to build a church to her honour in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
that city of Spain wherein he should make the
greatest number of converts, adding, that she
would give him farther instructions concerning
the edifice upon the spot. Santiago set sail,
landed in Galicia, and, having preached with
little success through the northern provinces,
reached Cæsarea-Augusta, where he made eight
disciples. One night, after he had been conversing
and praying with them as usual on the
banks of the river, they fell asleep, and just at
midnight the apostle heard heavenly voices sing,
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Ave Maria gratia plena!</i> He fell on his knees,
and instantly beheld the Virgin upon a marble
pillar in the midst of a choir of angels, who went
through the whole of her matin service. When
this was ended, she bade him build her church
around that pillar, which his Lord, her blessed
Son, had sent him by the hands of his angels;
there, she told him, that pillar was to remain till
the end of the world, and great mercies would
be vouchsafed there to those who supplicated for
them in her name. Having said this, the angels
transported her back to her house at Jerusalem,
(for this was before the Assumption) and Santiago,
in obedience, erected upon that spot the first
church which was ever dedicated to the Virgin<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Cathedral service was performed both in this
church and in the see, and the meetings of the
chapter were held alternately in each. The interior
of each was of the most imposing<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> kind.
When the elder of these joint cathedrals was
erected, Pope Gelasius granted indulgencies to
all persons who would contribute toward the
work, and thus introduced a practice which contributed
as much to the grandeur and magnificence
of ecclesiastical architecture, as to laxity
of morals and the prevalence of superstition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Contempt of the French for the Zaragozans.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Many mournful scenes of bigotry and superstition
have been exhibited in Zaragoza; but, in
these fiery trials which Buonaparte’s tyranny was
preparing for the inhabitants, the dross and tinsel
of their faith disappeared, and its pure gold remained.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
The French, accustomed as they were
to undervalue the Spanish character, had spoken
with peculiar contempt of the Zaragozans. “Few
persons,” they said, “are to be seen among them
who distinguish themselves by their dress; there
is little of that elegant attire so observable in large
cities. All is serious and regular, ... dull and monotonous.
The place seems without any kind of
resource, because the inhabitants use no effort to
obtain any; ... accustomed to a state of apathy and
languor, they have not an idea of the possibility
of shaking it off<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a>.” With this feeling, equally
despising the strength of the place, and the character
of the people, the French proceeded to
besiege the capital of Aragon. A party of their
cavalry entered the town on the 14th, perhaps in
pursuit of the retreating patriots; they thought
to scour the streets, but they were soon made to
feel, that the superiority of disciplined soldiers
to citizens exists only in the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 15.</span>
<br /><hr />
The French attempt to storm the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following morning, the French, with
part of their force, attacked the outposts upon
the canal, and, with their main body, attempted
to storm the city by the gate called Portillo.
A desperate conflict ensued. The Aragonese
fought with a spirit worthy of their cause. They
had neither time, nor room, nor necessity for
order. Their cannon, which they had hastily
planted before the gates, and in the best situations
without the town, were served by any persons<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
who happened to be near them; any one
gave orders who felt himself competent to take
the command. A party of the enemy entered
the city, and were all slain. Lefebvre perceived
that it was hopeless to persist in the attack with
his present force, and drew off his troops, having
suffered great loss. The patriots lost about 2000
men killed, and as many wounded. In such a
conflict the circumstances are so materially in
favour of the defendants, that the carnage made
among the French must have been much greater.
Some part of their baggage and plunder was
abandoned in their retreat. The conquerors
would have exposed themselves by a rash pursuit,
but Palafox exhorted them not to be impatient,
telling them, that the enemy would give
them frequent opportunities to display their
courage. While he thus restrained their impetuosity,
he continued to excite their zeal. This
victory, he said, was but the commencement of
the triumphs which they were to expect under
the powerful assistance of their divine patrons.
The precious blood of their brethren had been
shed in the field of glory, ... on their own soil.
Those blessed martyrs required new victims;
let us, he added, prepare for the sacrifice!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Palafox goes out to collect reinforcements.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Zaragozans had obtained only a respite;
defeated as he was, Lefebvre had only removed
beyond the reach of their guns; his troops were
far superior to any which they could bring against
him; and it was not to be doubted that he would
soon return in greater force, to take vengeance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
for the repulse and the disgrace which he had
suffered. A regular siege was to be expected;
how were the citizens to sustain it with their
brick walls, without heavy artillery, and without
troops who could sally to interrupt the besiegers
in their works? In spite of all these discouraging
circumstances, confiding in God and their
own courage, they determined to defend the
streets to the last extremity. Palafox, immediately
after the repulse of the enemy, set out
to muster reinforcements, to provide such resources
for the siege as he could, and to place
the rest of Aragon in a state of defence, if the
capital should fall. He was accompanied by
Colonel Butron, his friend and aide-de-camp;
Lieut.-Colonel Beillan, of the engineers; Padre
Basilio, and Tio Jorge. With these companions
and a small escort he left the city by the suburbs,
crossed the Ebro at Pina, and collecting on the
way about 1400 soldiers who had escaped from
Madrid, formed a junction at Belchite with Baron
Versage and some newly raised troops from Calatayud.
Their united numbers amounted to
some 7000 men, with 100 horse and four pieces
of artillery. Small as this force was, and still
more inefficient for want of discipline than of numerical
strength, Palafox resolved upon making
an attempt with it to succour the city. The
prudence of this determination was justly questioned
by some; others proposed the strange
measure of marching to Valencia: this probably
originated with some of the stray soldiers who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
were at liberty to seek their fortune where they
pleased, and the proposal was so well received
that a considerable party prepared to set off
in that direction, without orders. But Palafox
called them together, exhorted them to do their
duty, and offered passports to as many as chose
to leave him in the moment of danger. The
consequence of this offer was that not a man departed.
From Almunia, where he had rested a
day, he then marched towards Epila, thinking to
advance to the village of La Muela, and thus
place the invaders between his little army and
the city, in the hope of cutting them off from
their reinforcements. Lefebvre prevented this,
by suddenly attacking him at Epila, on the night
of the 23d: after a most obstinate resistance, the
superior arms and discipline of the French were
successful. The wreck of this gallant band retreated
to Calatayud, and afterwards, with great
difficulty, threw themselves into Zaragoza.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>G. Verdier joins Lefebvre with reinforcement.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The besiegers’ army was soon reinforced by
General Verdier, with 2500 men, besides some
battalions of Portugueze, who, according to the
devilish system of Buonaparte’s tyranny, had been
forced out of their own country, to be pushed
on in the foremost ranks, wherever the first fire
of a battery was to be received, a line of bayonets
clogged, or a ditch filled, with bodies. They
occupied the best positions in the surrounding
plain, and, on the 27th, attacked the city and
the Torrero; but they were repulsed with the
loss of 800 men, six pieces of artillery, and five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
carts of ammunition. By this time, they had
invested nearly half the town. The next morning
they renewed the attack at both places; from the
city they were again repulsed, losing almost all
the cavalry who were engaged. But the Torrero

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Torrero taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was lost through the alleged misconduct of an
artillery officer, who was charged with having
made his men abandon the batteries at the most
critical moment. For this he was condemned to
run the gauntlet six times, the soldiers beating
him with their ramrods, and after this cruelty he
was shot.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French bombard the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French, having now received a train of
mortars, howitzers, and twelve-pounders, which
were of sufficient calibre against mud walls, kept
up a constant fire, and showered down shells
and grenades from the Torrero. About twelve
hundred were thrown into the town, and there
was not one building that was bomb proof within
the walls. After a time, the inhabitants placed
beams of timber together, endways, against the
houses, in a sloping direction, behind which
those who were near when a shell fell, might
shelter themselves. The enemy continued also
to invest the city more closely, while the Aragonese
made every effort to strengthen their
means of defence. They tore down the awnings
from their windows, and formed them into sacks,
which they filled with sand, and piled up before
the gates, in the form of a battery, digging round
it a deep trench. They broke holes for musketry
in the walls and intermediate buildings, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
stationed cannon where the position was favourable
for it. The houses in the environs were
destroyed. “Gardens and olive grounds,” says
an eye-witness, “that in better times had been
the recreation and support of their owners, were
cheerfully rooted up by the proprietors themselves,
wherever they impeded the defence of
the city, or covered the approach of the enemy.”

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Exertions of the women.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Women of all ranks assisted; they formed themselves
into companies, some to relieve the
wounded, some to carry water, wine, and provisions,
to those who defended the gates. The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Countess Burita.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Countess Burita instituted a corps for this service;
she was young, delicate, and beautiful.
In the midst of the most tremendous fire of shot
and shells, she was seen coolly attending to those
occupations which were now become her duty;
nor throughout the whole of a two months’ siege
did the imminent danger, to which she incessantly
exposed herself, produce the slightest apparent
effect upon her, or in the slightest degree
bend her from her heroic purpose. Some of the
monks bore arms; others exercised their spiritual
offices to the dying: others, with the nuns, were
busied in making cartridges which the children
distributed.</p>

<p>Among threescore thousand persons there will
always be found some wicked enough for any
employment, and the art of corrupting has constituted
great part of the French system of war.
During the night of the 28th the powder magazine,
in the area where the bull-fights were performed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
which was in the very heart of the city,
was blown up, by which fourteen houses were
destroyed, and about 200 persons killed. This
was the signal for the enemy to appear before
three gates which had been sold to them. And
while the inhabitants were digging out their
fellow-citizens from the ruins, a fire was opened
upon them with mortars, howitzers, and cannons,
which had now been received for battering the
town. Their attack seemed chiefly to be directed
against the gate called Portillo, and a
large square building near it, without the walls,
and surrounded by a deep ditch; though called
a castle, it served only for a prison. The sand-bag
battery before this gate was frequently destroyed,
and as often reconstructed under the
fire of the enemy. The carnage here throughout

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Augustina Zaragoza.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the day was dreadful. Augustina Zaragoza,
a handsome woman of the lower class, about
twenty-two years of age, arrived at this battery
with refreshments, at the time when not a man
who defended it was left alive, so tremendous
was the fire which the French kept up against
it. For a moment the citizens hesitated to re-man
the guns. Augustina sprung forward over
the dead and dying, snatched a match from the
hand of a dead artilleryman, and fired off a six-and-twenty
pounder; then, jumping upon the
gun, made a solemn vow never to quit it alive
during the siege. Such a sight could not but
animate with fresh courage all who beheld it.
The Zaragozans rushed into the battery, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
renewed their fire with greater vigour than ever,
and the French were repulsed here, and at all
other points, with great slaughter. On the morning
of this day a fellow was detected going out
of the city with letters to Murat. It was not
till after these repeated proofs of treasonable
practices, that the French residents in Zaragoza,
with other suspected persons, were taken into
custody.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French again repulsed in an attempt to take the city by storm.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lefebvre now supposing that his destructive
bombardment must have dismayed the people,
and convinced them how impossible it was for
so defenceless a city to persist in withstanding
him, again attempted to force his way into the
town, thinking that, as soon as his troops could
effect a lodgement within the gates, the Zaragozans
would submit. On the 2d of July, a
column of his army marched out of their battery,
which was almost within musket-shot of the
Portillo, and advanced towards it with fixed
bayonets, and without firing a shot. But when
they reached the castle, such a discharge of
grape and musketry was opened upon their flank,
that, notwithstanding the most spirited exertions
of their officers, the column immediately dispersed.
The remainder of their force had been
drawn up to support their attack, and follow
them into the city; but it was impossible to
bring them a second time to the charge. The
general, however, ordered another column instantly
to advance against the gate of the Carmen,
on the left of the Portillo. This entrance
was defended by a sand-bag battery, and by musketeers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
who lined the walls on each side, and
commanded two out of three approaches to it;
and here also the French suffered great loss, and
were repulsed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They invest the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The military men in Zaragoza considered these
attacks as extremely injudicious. Lefebvre probably
was so indignant at meeting with any opposition
from a people whom he despised, and a
place which, according to the rules and pedantry
of war, was not tenable, that he lost his temper,
and thought to subdue them the shortest way,
by mere violence and superior force. Having
found his mistake, he proceeded to invest the
city still more closely. In the beginning of the
siege, the besieged received some scanty succours;
yet, however scanty, they were of importance.
Four hundred soldiers from the regiment
of Estremadura, small parties from other
corps, and a few artillerymen got in. Two hundred
of the militia of Logrono were added to
these artillerymen, and soon learnt their new
service, being in the presence of an enemy whom
they had such righteous reason to abhor. Two
four-and-twenty-pounders and a few shells, which
were much wanted, were procured from Lerida.
The enemy, meantime, were amply supplied with
stores from the magazine in the citadel of Pamplona,
which they had so perfidiously seized on
their first entrance, as allies, into Spain. Hitherto
they had remained on the right<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> bank of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Ebro. On the 11th of July they forced the passage
of the ford, and posted troops enough on
the opposite side to protect their workmen while
forming a floating bridge. In spite of all the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />July.</span>
They form a bridge over the Ebro.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

efforts of the Aragonese, this bridge was completed
on the 14th; a way was thus made for
their cavalry, to their superiority in which the
French were mostly indebted for all their victories
in Spain. This gave them the command
of the surrounding country; they destroyed the
mills, levied contributions on the villages, and
cut off every communication by which the besieged
had hitherto received supplies. These
new difficulties called out new resources in this
admirable people and their general, ... a man
worthy of commanding such a people in such
times. Corn mills, worked by horses, were
erected in various parts of the city; the monks
were employed in manufacturing gunpowder,
materials for which were obtained by immediately
collecting all the sulphur in the place,
by washing the soil of the streets to extract its
nitre, and making charcoal from the stalks of
hemp, which in that part of Spain grows to a
magnitude that would elsewhere be thought
very unusual<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distress of the inhabitants.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By the end of July the city was completely invested,
the supply of food was scanty, and the
inhabitants had no reason to expect succour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Their exertions had now been unremitted for
forty-six days, and nothing but the sense of duty
could have supported their bodily strength and
their spirit under such trials. They were in
hourly expectation of another general attack, or
another bombardment. They had not a single
place of security for the sick and the children, and
the number of wounded was daily increased by
repeated skirmishes, in which they engaged for
the purpose of opening a communication with
the country. At this juncture they made one
desperate effort to recover the Torrero. It was
in vain; and convinced by repeated losses, and
especially by this last repulse, that it was hopeless
to make any effectual sally, they resolved to
abide the issue of the contest within the walls,
and conquer or perish there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Foundling Hospital burnt.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">1808.<br />August.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the night of the second of August, and on
the following day, the French bombarded the
city from their batteries opposite the gate of
the Carmen. A foundling hospital, which was
now filled with the sick and wounded, took
fire, and was rapidly consumed. During this
scene of horror, the most intrepid exertions
were made to rescue these helpless sufferers
from the flames. No person thought of his own
property or individual concerns, ... every one
hastened thither. The women were eminently
conspicuous in their exertions, regardless of
the shot and shells which fell about them, and
braving the flames of the building. It has often
been remarked, that the wickedness of women<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
exceeds that of the other sex; ... for the same
reason, when circumstances, forcing them out
of the sphere of their ordinary nature, compel
them to exercise manly virtues, they display
them in the highest degree, and, when they are
once awakened to a sense of patriotism, they
carry the principle to its most heroic pitch.
The loss of women and boys, during this siege,
was very great, fully proportionate to that of
men; they were always the most forward, and
the difficulty was to teach them a prudent and
proper sense of their danger.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Convent of St. Engracia.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">August 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following day, the French completed
their batteries upon the right bank of the Guerva,
within pistol-shot of the gate of St. Engracia, so
called from a splendid church and convent of
Jeronimites, situated on one side of it. This
convent was, on many accounts, a remarkable
place. Men of letters beheld it with reverence,
because the excellent historian Zurita spent the
last years of his life there, observing the rules of
the community, though he had not entered into
the order; and because he was buried there, and
his countryman and fellow-labourer, Geronymo
de Blancas, after him. Devotees revered it, even
in the neighbourhood of our Lady of the Pillar,
for its relics and the saint to whom it was dedicated.
According to the legend, she was the
daughter of Ont Comerus, a barbarian chief, in
the pay of the Romans, by whom the city of
Norba Cæsarea, (situated near the Tagus, between
the present towns of Portalegre and Alcantara)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
was given him, together with its district,
for his service in recovering it from Cathelius, a
chief of the Alemanni. His daughter, Encratis,
or Encratide, (for from one of these names Engracia
has been formed) was brought up a
Christian, and espoused to a governor on the
Gallic side of the Pyrenees, to whom she was
sent with a suitable escort. Their way lay
through Cæsarea-Augusta, where the Præses,
or Governor of Spain, Publius Dacianus, the
bloodiest minister of the tenth persecution, was
at that time endeavouring to extirpate Christianity.
Engracia, either preferring martyrdom
to her unknown spouse, or imagining that her
rank would be her safeguard, visited the governor
for the purpose of interceding in behalf
of the Christians, and remonstrating against his
cruelty. Thus much of the legend is probably
fabulous; but certain it is, that a virgin of that
name was tortured under that persecution; and,
though she survived, was venerated as a<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>martyr<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
in that city, before the close of the century in
which she suffered. Just, however, as her claim
is to pious remembrance, her church, and the
divine honours which have been paid to her,
were procured by fraud. Angels are said to have
descended at her death, and to have officiated at
her funeral, bearing tapers and thuribules, and
singing hymns of triumph. During the Moorish
captivity, her relics disappeared; they were discovered
towards the close of the fourteenth century,
which was the great age for inventions of
this kind. There stood at that time, upon the
site of this memorable convent, an old church,
dedicated to the Zaragozan martyrs, of the tenth
persecution, and called the <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Iglesia de las Masas</i>,
in memory of an early specimen of Catholic ingenuity.
Dacianus, holding relic-worship in as
much contempt as the Christians did his idolatry,
in order to prevent them from indulging in it,
burnt the bodies of the martyrs, together with
those of some malefactors, thinking that their
ashes would be undistinguishable; nevertheless,
the Christians found their own, which had collected
together in white balls or masses, separate
from the rest. In 1389, the regular canons, to
whom the church belonged, resolved to rebuild
a part of it: in digging the foundation, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
marble chests were discovered. The lid of the
smaller was fastened down very firmly with a
sort of pitch; when this was taken off, two sets
of human bones were found in different compartments;
over the one were the words <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Lupercii
Martyris</i>, sculptured in the marble; over
the other, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Engratiæ Virginis</i>: these latter were
of rose-colour, which was admitted as proof of
their authenticity. The larger chest contained
a great assortment of anonymous bones, ashes,
and the white masses, which had disappeared for
so many centuries. The mine was very rich;
the workmen went on till they had invented
thirteen chests, and at last, a whole pit full of
relics, not the less efficacious because it could
not be ascertained to whom they had belonged.
Seventy years afterwards, Juan II. of Aragon,
one of the wickedest and most perfidious of men,
fancied or feigned, that by St. Engracia’s intercession,
he was cured of a complaint in his eyes;
in consequence of which, he resolved to enlarge
this church, and build a monastery adjoining it
for the Jeronimites, ... an order which, during
that and the succeeding age, was in great favour
at the three courts of the Peninsula. He began
his work, but died without completing it, leaving
that charge by will to his son, Ferdinand, the
Catholic king. He continued the building, but
it was not finished till the reign of Charles the
Fifth.</p>

<p>Both the church and convent were splendidly
adorned, but the most remarkable part of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
whole edifice was a subterranean church, formed
in the place where the relics were discovered,
and having the pit, or well, as it was called, in
the middle. It was divided by a beautiful iron
grating, which excluded laymen from the interior
of the sanctuary. There were three descents;
the widest flight of steps was that which was for
public use, the two others were for the religioners,
and met in one behind the three chief altars,
within the grating. Over the midst of these
altars were two tombs, placed one upon the
other in a niche; the under one containing the
relics of Engracia’s companions and fellows in
martyrdom; the upper, those of the saint herself,
her head excepted, which was kept in a silver
shrine, having a collar of precious stones, and
enclosed in crystal. The altars on either side
had their respective relics; and several others,
equally rich in such treasures, were ranged along
the walls, without the grating. The roof was of
an azure colour, studded with stars to represent
the sky. The breadth of the vault considerably
exceeded its length; it was sixty feet wide, and
only forty long. Thirty little columns, of different
marbles, supported the roof. On the stone
brink of the well, the history of the Zaragozan
martyrs was represented in bas-relief; and an
iron grating, reaching to the roof, secured it
from being profaned by idle curiosity, and from
the pious larcenies which it might otherwise have
tempted. Within this cage-work, a silver lamp
was suspended. Thirty such lamps were burning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
there day and night; and, though the roof was
little more than twelve feet high, it was never in
the slightest degree sullied with smoke. The
fact is certain<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>; but the useful and important
secret, by which oil was made to burn without
producing smoke, was carefully concealed; and
the Jeronimites continued till this time to exhibit
a miracle, which puzzled all who did not believe
it to be miraculous.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The hospital set on fire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 4th of August, the French opened
batteries within pistol-shot of this church and
convent. The mud walls were levelled at the
first discharge; and the besiegers rushing through
the opening, took the batteries before the adjacent
gates in reverse. Here General Mori,
who had distinguished himself on many former
occasions, was made prisoner. The street of St.
Engracia, which they had thus entered, leads
into the Cozo, and the corner buildings where
it thus terminated, were on the one hand the
convent of St. Francisco, and on the other the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
General Hospital. Both were stormed and set
on fire; the sick and the wounded threw themselves
from the windows to escape the flames,
and the horror of the scene was aggravated by
the maniacs, whose voices raving or singing in
paroxysms of wilder madness, or crying in vain
to be set free, were heard amid the confusion of
dreadful sounds. Many fell victims to the fire,
and some to the indiscriminating fury of the
assailants. Those who escaped were conducted
as prisoners to the Torrero; but when their condition
had been discovered, they were sent back
on the morrow, to take their chance in the siege.
After a severe contest and dreadful carnage,
the French forced their way into the Cozo, in
the very centre of the city, and, before the day
closed, were in possession of one half of Zaragoza.
Lefebvre now believed that he had effected
his purpose, and required Palafox to surrender,
in a note containing only these words: “Head-quarters,
St. Engracia. Capitulation<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a>!” The
heroic Spaniard immediately returned this reply:
“Head-quarters, Zaragoza. War at the knife’s
point<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>War in the streets.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The contest which was now carried on is unexampled
in history. One side of the Cozo, a
street about as wide as Pall-mall, was possessed
by the French; and, in the centre of it, their
general, Verdier, gave his orders from the Franciscan
convent. The opposite side was maintained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
by the Aragonese, who threw up batteries
at the openings of the cross streets, within a few
paces of those which the French erected against
them. The intervening space was presently
heaped with dead, either slain upon the spot, or

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

thrown out from the windows. Next day the
ammunition of the citizens began to fail; ... the
French were expected every moment to renew
their efforts for completing the conquest, and
even this circumstance occasioned no dismay,
nor did any one think of capitulation. One cry
was heard from the people, wherever Palafox
rode among them, that, if powder failed, they
were ready to attack the enemy with their knives,
... formidable weapons in the hands of desperate

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The city receives a reinforcement.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

men. Just before the day closed, Don Francisco
Palafox, the general’s brother, entered the city
with a convoy of arms, and ammunition, and a
reinforcement of three thousand men, composed
of Spanish guards, Swiss, and volunteers of Aragon,
... a succour as little expected by the Zaragozans,
as it had been provided against by the
enemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>P. Santiago Sass.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The war was now continued from street to
street, from house to house, and from room to
room; pride and indignation having wrought up
the French to a pitch of obstinate fury, little
inferior to the devoted courage of the patriots.
During the whole siege, no man distinguished
himself more remarkably than the curate of one
of the parishes, within the walls, by name P.
Santiago Sass. He was always to be seen in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
streets, sometimes fighting with the most determined
bravery against the enemies, not of his
country alone, but of freedom, and of all virtuous
principles, wherever they were to be found; at
other times, administering the sacrament to the
dying, and confirming, with the authority of faith,
that hope, which gives to death, under such circumstances,
the joy, the exultation, the triumph,
and the spirit of martyrdom. Palafox reposed
the utmost confidence in this brave priest, and
selected him whenever any thing peculiarly difficult
or hazardous was to be done. At the head
of forty chosen men, he succeeded in introducing
a supply of powder into the town, so essentially
necessary for its defence.</p>

<p>This most obstinate and murderous contest
was continued for eleven successive days and
nights, more indeed by night than by day; for
it was almost certain death to appear by daylight
within reach of those houses which were
occupied by the other party. But under cover
of the darkness, the combatants frequently dashed
across the street to attack each other’s batteries;
and the battles which began there, were often
carried on into the houses beyond, where they
fought from room to room, and floor to floor.
The hostile batteries were so near each other,
that a Spaniard in one place made way under
cover of the dead bodies, which completely filled
the space between them, and fastened a rope to
one of the French cannons; in the struggle
which ensued, the rope broke, and the Zaragozans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
lost their prize at the very moment when
they thought themselves sure of it<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Number of the dead.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A new horror was added to the dreadful circumstances
of war in this ever memorable siege.
In general engagements the dead are left upon
the field of battle, and the survivors remove to
clear ground and an untainted atmosphere; but
here ... in Spain, and in the month of August,
there where the dead lay the struggle was still
carried on, and pestilence was dreaded from
the enormous accumulation of putrifying bodies.
Nothing in the whole course of the siege so
much embarrassed Palafox as this evil. The
only remedy was to tie ropes to the French prisoners,
and push them forward amid the dead
and dying, to remove the bodies, and bring them
away for interment. Even for this necessary
office there was no truce, and it would have been
certain death to the Aragonese who should have
attempted to perform it; but the prisoners were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
in general secured by the pity of their own
soldiers, and in this manner the evil was, in some
degree, diminished.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of the enemy.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A council of war was held by the Spaniards
on the 8th, not for the purpose which is too
usual in such councils, but that their heroic resolution
might be communicated with authority
to the people. It was, that in those quarters of
the city where the Aragonese still maintained
their ground, they should continue to defend
themselves with the same firmness: should the
enemy at last prevail, they were then to retire
over the Ebro into the suburbs, break down the
bridge, and defend the suburbs till they perished.
When this resolution was made public, it was
received with the loudest acclamations. But in
every conflict the citizens now gained ground
upon the soldiers, winning it inch by inch, till
the space occupied by the enemy, which on the
day of their entrance was nearly half the city,
was gradually reduced to about an eighth part.
Meantime, intelligence of the events in other
parts of Spain was received by the French, ... all
tending to dishearten them; the surrender of
Dupont, the failure of Moncey before Valencia,
and the news that the Junta of that province had
dispatched six thousand men to join the levies
in Aragon, which were destined to relieve Zaragoza.
During the night of the 13th, their fire
was particularly fierce and destructive; after
their batteries had ceased, flames burst out in
many parts of the buildings which they had won;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
their last act was to blow up the church of St.
Engracia; the powder was placed in the subterranean
church, ... and this remarkable place, ...
this monument of fraud and of credulity, ... the
splendid theatre wherein so many feelings of
deep devotion had been excited, ... which so
many thousands had visited in faith, and from
which unquestionably many had departed with
their imaginations elevated, their principles ennobled,
and their hearts strengthened, was laid
in ruins. In the morning the French columns,
to the great surprise of the Spaniards, were seen
at a distance, retreating over the plain, on the
road to Pamplona.</p>

<p>The history of a battle, however skilfully
narrated, is necessarily uninteresting to all except
military men; but in the detail of a siege,
when time has destroyed those considerations,
which prejudice or pervert our natural sense of
right and wrong, every reader sympathizes with
the besieged, and nothing, even in fictitious narratives,
excites so deep and animating an interest.
There is not, either in the annals of
ancient or of modern times, a single event recorded
more worthy to be held in admiration,
now and for evermore, than the siege of Zaragoza.
Will it be said that this devoted people
obtained for themselves, by all this heroism and
all these sacrifices, nothing more than a short
respite from their fate? Woe be to the slavish
heart that conceives the thought, and shame to
the base tongue that gives it utterance! They<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
purchased for themselves an everlasting remembrance
upon earth, ... a place in the memory and
love of all good men in all ages that are yet to
come. They performed their duty; they redeemed
their souls from the yoke; they left an
example to their country, never to be forgotten,
never to be out of mind, and sure to contribute
to and hasten its deliverance.</p>

<p>One of the first cares of Palafox, after the delivery
of the city, was, to establish a board of
health to provide against the effects of putrefaction,
... such was the number of French who
were left dead in the houses and in the streets.
Pamplona, whither the wreck of their army retreated,
was for many days filled with carts full
and horse-loads of wounded, who arrived faster
and in greater number than they could be lodged
in the hospitals and convents. It was equally
shocking to humanity to behold their sufferings,
and the cruel regardlessness of their comrades,
who, while these wretches were fainting for want
of assistance and of food, and literally dying in
the streets, were exposing their booty to sale, and
courting purchasers for church plate, watches,
jewels, linen, and apparel, the plunder which
they had collected in Navarre and Aragon; and
which, in their eagerness to convert into money,
they were offering at a small part of their value.
There were, however, scarcely any purchasers
except for the church plate, which was bought
for the purpose of restoring it, at the same cost,
to the churches and monasteries from whence it
had been stolen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
The temper of the Zaragozans after their victory
was not less heroic than their conduct during
the struggle. It might have been expected that
some degree of exhaustion would have succeeded
the state of excitement to which they had been
wrought; and that the widowed, the childless,
and they who were left destitute, would now
have lamented what they had lost, or, at least,
that they themselves had not perished also. This,
however, was not so. Mr. Vaughan visited Zaragoza
a little while after the siege, and remained
there during several weeks: he saw (they are his
own impressive words) “many a parent who had
lost his children, and many a man reduced from
competence to poverty, but he literally did not
meet with one human being who uttered the
slightest complaint: every feeling seemed to be
swallowed up in the memory of what they had
recently done, and in a just hatred of the French.”
These are the effects of patriotism, aided and
strengthened by religion: its influence, thus
elevated and confirmed, made women and boys
efficient in the time of action, and the streets of
a city not less formidable to an invader than the
best constructed works of defence. Let not the
faith which animated the Aragonese be called
superstition, because our Lady of the Pillar,
Santiago, and St. Engracia, were its symbols.
It was virtually and essentially religion in its
inward life and spirit; it was the sense of what
they owed equally to their forefathers and their
children; the knowledge that their cause was as
righteous as any for which an injured and insulted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
people ever rose in arms; the hope that
by the blessing of God upon that cause they
might succeed; the certain faith that if they
fell, it was with the feeling, the motive, and the
merit of martyrdom. Life or death therefore
became to the Zaragozans only not indifferent,
because life was useful to the cause for which
they held it in trust, and were ready to lay it
down: they who fell expired in triumph, and
the survivors rather envied than regretted them.
The living had no fears for themselves, and for
the same reason they could have no sorrows for
the dead. The whole greatness of our nature
was called forth, ... a power which had lain dormant,
and of which the possessors themselves
had not suspected the existence, till it manifested
itself in the hour of trial.</p>

<p>When the dead were removed, and the
ruins sufficiently cleared, Ferdinand was proclaimed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with all the usual solemnities; a ceremony,
at other times attended with no other
feeling than such as sports and festivity occasion,
now made affecting by the situation of
Ferdinand himself, and the scene which surrounded
the spectators; walls blackened with
fire, shattered with artillery, and stained with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

blood. The obsequies of the Spaniards who had
fallen were next performed with military honours,
and their funeral oration pronounced
from the pulpit. The brave priest Santiago Sass
was made chaplain to the commander in chief,
and Palafox gave him a captain’s commission.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
These were times when the religion of Mattathias
and the Maccabees was required; and the
priest of the altar was in the exercise of his
duty, when defending it, sword in hand, in the
field. A pension was settled upon Augustina,
and the daily pay of an artilleryman. She was
also to wear a small shield of honour embroidered
upon the sleeve of her gown, with Zaragoza inscribed
upon it. Tio Jorge was killed during the
siege. Other persons, who had distinguished
themselves, were rewarded; and the general
reward which Palafox conferred upon the Zaragozan
people, is strongly characteristic of Spanish

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

feeling. By his own authority, and in the name of
Ferdinand, he conferred upon all the inhabitants
of the city and its districts, of both sexes and
of all ranks, the perpetual and irrevocable privilege
of never being adjudged to any disgraceful
punishment by any tribunal for any offence, except
for treason or blasphemy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />May.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="firstword">While</span> these events were passing in Spain,
Portugal also was convulsed by this political

earthquake. The first insurrection in Madrid
had been no sooner known at Badajoz, than an
anonymous proclamation from that city was circulated
on the Portugueze border; and a lieutenant
of the Walloon Guards, by name Moretti,
was sent to consult at Lisbon with General Carraffa
upon the means of withdrawing the Spanish
troops. Carraffa thought it too hazardous to declare

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, t. iii. 7.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

himself at that time; but though in other
respect acting altogether in subservience to
Junot, he did not make him acquainted with
the transaction, and Moretti returned in safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulties of Junot’s situation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Junot was now disturbed from his dreams of
royalty; yet his head lay as uneasily as if it had
worn a crown. Like the other French commanders,
when the insurrectionary movement
became general throughout Spain, he thought
it impossible that any continued or formidable
resistance could be opposed to the power of
France: but his own situation was exposed to
peculiar danger; he was farther removed from
assistance than any of the other commanders in
the Peninsula; there was an English squadron<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
in sight, watching the course of events, and in defiance
of all his vigilance, well informed of whatever
was going on; and it was not to be doubted,
that if a favourable opportunity offered, Great
Britain would make an effort for the deliverance
of Portugal. Pursuant to his instructions from
Madrid, he had sent into Galicia the remains of
Taranco’s division, so that Carraffa’s was now
the only one which remained; some 4000 of
these were at Porto, the rest were in detachments
at Lisbon, Mafra, Santarem, and on the
other side the Tagus at Setubal, Cezimbra, and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 66.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

other places. In the hope of exciting a national
feeling against them, and thereby counteracting
that sympathy which their common language,
manners, and religion, and now a sense of their
common interest, were producing between them
and the Portugueze, rumours were spread, that
by an arrangement made with Buonaparte, Portugal
was to be governed by Spain till its fate
should be determined at a general peace. But
this artifice failed. The Spaniards were not to
be deceived; from the time when they knew
that Ferdinand had been inveigled to Bayonne,
there was an end of all good understanding between
them and the French; and they were so
ready to engage in personal quarrels, from the
national indignation which possessed them, that
it was found necessary to confine them to their
quarters at an early hour in the evening. Care
was taken to divide them into small detachments,
and station every where with them a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
superior number of French. Many deserted,
especially of those who were quartered beyond
the Tagus. Some made their way to the Spanish
frontiers in strong parties. The regiment of
Murcia marched for Spain in a body, in defiance
of its colonel; a detachment of 600 French was
sent from Lisbon to intercept them; they met at

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 67.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Os Pegoens; this was a case in which individual

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 287.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

strength and determination were of more avail
than military discipline; the Spaniards were victorious,
and proceeded on their way, receiving
the utmost kindness from the people, and nearly
two hundred wounded French were landed at
Lisbon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kellermann takes the command in Alem-Tejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Badajoz was the point to which the Spaniards
repaired from Alem-Tejo and the south of Portugal,
and the numbers who were collected there
made such an addition to the strength of the
garrison, that General Kellermann, who was then
at Elvas, felt himself ill at ease in the neighbourhood.
That general had taken the command in
Alem-Tejo upon Solano’s departure, and so different
was the spirit of his administration, that
one of his first measures was by his own authority
to impose an extraordinary contribution upon the
exhausted province. Evora was to pay 10,000
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">cruzados novos</i>, Elvas and Portalegre 8000 each,
Villa-Viçosa 6000, and other places in proportion.
The sum was exacted within six hours
after the demand: but it was restored without

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, p. 277.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

delay, in consequence of peremptory orders from
Junot, when complaint was made to him of this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
unauthorized exaction. He was displeased with
Kellermann for presuming to levy money at his
own pleasure, and this was no time for exasperating
the people by farther acts of oppression.
Already they were in so perturbed a state, that it

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">May 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was deemed expedient to order all absent bishops
and beneficed priests to return to their dioceses
and cures, and there exert themselves in preserving
order, and exhorting the people to submission.
Buonaparte had reckoned upon the good services
of the clergy; experience, he said, had shown
him that countries where there were many friars
were easily conquered; ... he was undeceived of
both errors in the Peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He attempts to conciliate the Spaniards at Badajoz.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the hope of reviving old animosities, and
exciting the Portugueze to act against the Spaniards,
Kellermann called out the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Ordenanças</i>,
and required the people of Elvas to take arms
for the defence of their city, which, he said, the
Spaniards, eternal enemies to the name and independence
of Portugal, were preparing to attack

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

from Badajoz. At the same time he sent a letter
to the Spaniards of that place, exhorting them
to return to their duty, and promising intercession,
and pardon and protection. No answer was
returned; he then put forth an argumentative
address to the Commandant and the Representatives
of Extremadura, asking them what end
they could propose to themselves from the revolt
in which they had blindly engaged? The House
of Bourbon had renounced all its rights to Spain;
Ferdinand was in France, and the right of appointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
a king for the Spaniards had been transferred

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />June.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to the Emperor. Did they wish to draw
upon themselves the evils by which France had
been ravaged during so many years? If that
country had come with glory out of a struggle
which would for ever be celebrated, it was owing
to her internal strength, her valour, and above
all the talents of that extraordinary man whom
Heaven had sent to reign over her, for her happiness,
and for the happiness of the Spaniards
also, if they chose it. Could they expect a like
issue? Would valour alone suffice to effect it?
What was their position? Half Spain had declared
for the new order of things. Their own countrymen
would take the field against them. The
French armies were in the midst of the land,
under the greatest generals, without enemies,
and abundantly supplied with all the means of
war. On their part they had only some soldiers
who had murdered their chiefs; a populace vain
of their own strength, because they had met with
no resistance; and a few miserable English, the
eternal artists of discord, active in stirring up
enemies to the French, and always ready, like
cowards, to abandon the victims of their infernal
policy. Nor was there any thing in the change
which had taken place to provoke their opposition.
At the commencement of the preceding
century Spain had called Philip V. to the throne,
for the purpose of establishing an invariable union

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 288.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with France. The establishment upon that throne
of a prince of the new French dynasty was nothing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
more than a consequence of the system
which Spain had then adopted, and which was
now confirmed. There was yet time to choose.
The sword was not yet drawn, the door was still
open for reconciliation, ... and he requested that
they would not close the gate of their city against
his communications. To this also no answer was
vouchsafed. He made a third effort, telling them
that he would suspend hostilities till they should
be better informed, and desiring the Junta to
meet him at the Caya, the little stream which
there divides the kingdoms. No persons were
there to meet him; and he then began to store
the forts of Elvas, and to devise plans for attacking
Badajoz, expecting, no doubt, that some of
the troops in Spain would be ordered upon that
service. Believing too that fêtes and rejoicings
would have as much effect in Portugal as in
France, he appointed a day of public thanksgiving
for the benefits which Napoleon had promised
to confer upon the Portugueze. They
were not a people to be thus deceived. Their
hearts were with the Spaniards, and so many
repaired to Badajoz, where D. Joseph Galluzo,
with great activity, was forming a camp, that
they were incorporated in a legion of foreign
volunteers, the command of which was given
to Moretti. Many artillerymen escaped thither
from Elvas; some hundred of the Portugueze
troops whom the French had ordered away for
foreign consumption, had been collected there;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 75.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

promotion was offered to all officers of that nation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
who should join them, and Kellermann’s vigilance
could not prevent the emigration which
took place in consequence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distribution of the French troops in Portugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A considerable garrison was required in Elvas,
as being the strongest fortress in the kingdom,
and now of more importance because of the
hostile attitude which the Spaniards at Badajoz
had assumed. Strong garrisons were placed at
Peniche and Setubal, for fear of the English.
Almeida also had been occupied by the French.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 77.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Except the troops in that place there were no
other French in the whole north of Portugal
than the small parties stationed upon the military
road, a weak detachment at Figueira, and some
fifty men at Coimbra. The great body of the
French was collected at Lisbon, and in the adjacent
country, where, in case of sudden danger,
they might be brought to act promptly and with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spaniards at Porto declare against the Intruder, and march into Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

effect. Porto was in possession of the Spaniards,
who had occupied it by virtue of the secret treaty
of Fontainebleau. General Bellesta, however,
upon whom the command had devolved, had been
placed under the orders of the French General
Quesnel, when the abortive kingdom of Northern
Lusitania was no longer held out as a lure to the
court of Spain. Quesnel had with him about
seventy dragoons, and a few other French, holding
military or civil situations. When news
arrived of the movements in Gallicia, Bellesta,
obeying without hesitation the voice of his country,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

arrested the French and their general, and
convoking the military, judicial, and civil authorities,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
explained to them briefly the situation of
affairs, expressed a hope that Junot would by
that time have been seized in Lisbon, as Quesnel
was in Porto, and asked of them what course
they would pursue, ... whether they would restore
the national government, choose a Spanish
one, or remain in submission to the French?
The <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Vereador</i>, Thomas da Silva Ferras, replied,
that he, and the chamber, and the city, desired
nothing more than to be under the government
of their lawful sovereign, and required that the
royal arms might immediately be re-established.
A <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Desembargador</i> ventured to observe, that they
had no authority to determine such things, not
being representatives of the people; that they
were without arms, ... that they had no means of
resisting so terrible an enemy as the French;
and that it was better to wait till they knew what
had happened at Lisbon. Reasonable as the fear
was which this speaker expressed, a more generous
feeling prevailed, and by Bellesta’s orders
the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Sargento Mor</i>, Raymundo José Pinheiro,
went from the meeting to take the command of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. c. 6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the fortress of S. Joam da Foz, at the mouth of
the Douro.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The lawful government restored at Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was late at night when the meeting broke
up. Raymundo called together his officers; they
bound themselves by a formal deed and solemn
oath to act for the service of their lawful Prince
against the French, and invoking the aid of Our
Lady of the Rosary, to whom that castle was dedicated,
vowed in the Prince’s name to solemnize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
the anniversary of that day by a festival to her
honour. At daybreak the Quinas were once
more seen flying upon the fortress, a royal salute
was fired, and returned from the castles of Queijo
and Matozinhos, the bells were rung, rockets
were discharged, and the people gave themselves
up to joy. The Spaniards without delay marched
for Coruña, taking with them their prisoners.
An English brig of war, which was cruising off
the river, hearing an unusual stir in the city,
drew near in hopes of ascertaining the cause;
Raymundo went on board, he was received with
due honours, and an officer returned to shore

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 85–91.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with him, and was sent to Luiz de Oliveira da
Costa, who commanded at Porto during the absence
of General Bernardim Freire de Andrada.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The governor adheres to the French, and suppresses the insurrection.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Luiz de Oliveira had been present at the meeting
which Bellesta convened, and assented to
the resolution which had there been taken.
Whether his heart was with his voice on that
occasion, or whether he had submitted to the
prevailing opinion only while it was dangerous
to oppose it, the fear of the French returned
upon him, now that the Spaniards had left Porto
to its own means of defence; and instead of receiving
the English officer with open arms, he
wrote to Raymundo, calling him to account for
having opened a communication with the English
brig, and saying that he knew nothing of the
business. Raymundo replied with great spirit,
that if the governor had forgotten what passed
when the government of the Prince Regent was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
re-established, he had not; he and his officers
had proclaimed their beloved Sovereign, he had
invited the English commander, in the Prince’s
name, to assist him; and if any person disputed
the propriety of what he had done, he would
make that person know what the power of the
royal name was, and that that port was open for
the English. Raymundo’s means, however, were
not commensurate with his will; the people of
Porto were disheartened by the departure of the
Spaniards, and the city remained to all appearance
in perfect submission to the French government,
while the Portugueze flag was flying at
S. Joam da Foz. A lieutenant-colonel, by name
Manoel Ribeiro de Araujo, now presented himself
in that fortress with an order from Oliveira
to take the command. Raymundo told him, that
if it were taken for the service of the Prince, he
was ready to resign it into his hands; but if it
were his intention to follow the French part, he
might return to the place from whence he came,
for within those walls no other name should be
acknowledged than that of the lawful sovereign,
and not a shot should be fired from them against
the English. Araujo returned in the evening
with fair words, and invited Raymundo to the
governor’s house, there to confer with him upon
the best mode of proceeding in the present critical
circumstances. The treacherous invitation was
accepted, and he had no sooner set foot within
Oliveira’s apartment than he was arrested as a
disturber of the people. The next step would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
have been to deliver him up to the French, and
to certain death; but though he had with strange
want of circumspection walked into the snare,
neither his courage nor his presence of mind forsook
him. Oliveira, with Araujo and another
officer, went out into the varanda to give directions

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 91–97.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

concerning him; Raymundo, who was
left alone in the apartment, quietly locked the
varanda door, and lost no time in gaining a place
of concealment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junot disarms and seizes the Spaniards at Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Bellesta had left a letter for Junot, which the
Chamber of Porto, as soon as his departure left
them to the sense of their own weakness, dispatched
to Lisbon, with assurance of their continued
submission to the French. The news
reached him at the close of an entertainment
given by the French officers at the theatre, where,
though the Russian admiral and his officers were
present, the portrait of Buonaparte was displayed,
with the Russian flag lying among other trophies

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 292.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

at his feet. A sense of insecurity was manifested
amid their festivities; the avenues to the theatre
were occupied by armed troops, fire engines were
made ready, and all the watermen were ordered
to be at hand with their barrels full. The entertainment
continued till four in the morning, and
immediately afterward movements were observed
which indicated that some important intelligence
had arrived; couriers were sent off, troops crossed
the Tagus, and detachments marched to Mafra,
Santarem, and other places. A body of Spaniards
who were stationed in the Campo de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
Ourique were ordered to the Convent of S. Francisco
da Cidade, an unfinished pile of enormous
magnitude, which the French occupied as barracks,
and where a thousand men were waiting
to disarm them as soon as they should enter.
The Spaniards, when they drew nigh, suspected

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 295.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

some ill design, and fixing their bayonets, declared
they would not be quartered there. They
were allowed to return without interruption; and
in the evening they and their countrymen at
Val de Pereiro, being in all 1200, were ordered
to assemble at two in the morning, in the Terreiro
do Paço, there to embark and cross the
river on their way to Spain. Thither they repaired
joyfully, and found 3000 troops awaiting
them, with cannon placed under the arcades of
that great square, and at the mouths of the streets
which open into it; and they were summoned to
lay down their arms and baggage, and surrender.
In the course of that and the succeeding day,
the Spaniards from Mafra and other parts were
brought in as prisoners, in a condition which
excited the compassion of the people, their women
exhausted with the fatigue of marching in
the burning heat of summer, some carrying children
at the breast, and some, who were unable
to walk, tied upon the baggage carts, lest they
should be thrown off. The whole number of
Spaniards thus arrested was somewhat above
4500; they were confined in hulks upon the
Tagus. The officers were left at liberty upon
their parole; but after a few days, when several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
had broken an engagement, which, considering
the manner in which they had been seized, they
did not think themselves bound in honour to
observe, they were placed under the same confinement
as the men. Junot then informed his
army, in public orders, that the infamous conduct
of the Spanish General Bellesta, the revolt of
two regiments, the arrest of some of his officers
at Badajoz and at Ciudad Rodrigo, and the inability
of the Spanish commanders to control
their men, had compelled him to this severe
measure. Happily it had been executed without
shedding blood. These Spaniards were not
enemies; they should receive pay and provisions
as heretofore, and their actual situation in no
degree altered his good disposition toward them.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 99-109.
<br />
Observador Portuguez, 300.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

He expressed his satisfaction at the conduct of
his soldiers; and said, that if the English thought
proper to make an attack, they were now fully
at leisure to receive them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junot’s proclamation to the Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He addressed a proclamation also to the Portugueze,
wherein with incautious effrontery he
avowed the double treachery which had been

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

practised upon them and upon the Spaniards.
After six months of tranquillity, he said, the
peace of the kingdom had been in danger of
being disturbed by the Spanish troops, who
entered the country apparently as allies, but in
reality with the intention of dismembering it.
No sooner had he in the Emperor’s name taken
possession of the whole government, than they
had begun to show their dissent: and at length<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
their conduct at Porto, and in other places, had
compelled him to disarm all who were within his
reach. “Portugueze,” he continued, “I have
hitherto been satisfied with your good disposition.
You have known how to appreciate the advantages
which must result to you from the protection
of Napoleon the Great. You have had confidence
in me. Continue it, and I will guarantee
your country from all invasion, from all dismemberment.
If the English, who know not
how to do any thing except fomenting discord,
choose to seek us, they will find us ready to defend
you. Some of your militia and your remaining
troops shall make part of my army to cover
your frontiers; they will be instructed in the art
of war, and if I may be fortunate enough to put
in practice the lessons which I learnt from Napoleon,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 297.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

I will teach you how to conquer.” Junot
seems at this time to have aimed at conciliating
the Portugueze soldiers, and making them act
with his army. For this purpose he announced
certain new regulations by which they were
placed upon the same footing with the French

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

as to their pay and provisions. Hitherto four-fifths
of their pay had been in paper money, which
was at a great discount; the proportion was now
reduced to two-thirds. A promise was made that
the first item in the monthly military expenses
should be for the allowance of the Portugueze
prisoners in Algiers. The manner in which it
was notified that the troops were to be under
French command, was not in the imperious tone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
which the Duke of Abrantes, as he styled himself,
heretofore had used; they were to form part
of the divisions, it was said, within whose districts
they were stationed; consequently the
French commanders were to include them in
their reports, and inspect and review them, to
see that they received what was their due, and
to perfect and accelerate their instruction. The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 303.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

artillery, cavalry, engineers, and marine, were to
be immediately under the orders of the respective
French generals, who by this means would know
their force, watch over their instruction, and see
to their welfare: the intention of his majesty
being, that the Portugueze troops should be
treated in the same manner as his own in all
respects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Festival of the Corpo de Deos at Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But it was too late for conciliation and flattery,
after so many acts of insolent oppression: and
an accident at this time occurred to manifest

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with what suspicious apprehensions the French
and the inhabitants of Lisbon mutually regarded
each other. The day arrived for the annual procession
of the Corpo de Deos. In the days of
Joam V. this had been the most splendid display
which the Catholic religion exhibited in Europe;
and though in latter years the management had
been less perfect, and there had been some diminution
of its splendour, it was still a spectacle
of unrivalled magnificence and riches. The
streets of the capital on that occasion, and that
only, were cleaned and strewn with fine gravel;
the houses were hung with damask; the troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
in their new uniforms, the various companies
and brotherhoods, civil and religious, each with
their banners, the knights of the military orders,
and all the monks and friars of Lisbon, moved in
the procession; which was closed by the dignitaries
of the patriarchal church, the Prince in
person, and the chief persons of his court, following
the great object of Catholic adoration, which
on that day, and that day only, was actually carried
abroad. The most remarkable object in this
pompous display used to be an image of St.
George in complete armour, upon a beautiful
horse, led by a squire and supported by pages on
each side, and accompanied by the finest horses
from the royal stables, with rich housings, and
escutcheons thrown across their saddles. These
horses and the saint had formed part of the procession
from the year 1387, with one interruption
only, early in the seventeenth century, when, at
the instigation of a certain Mordomo, the Archbishop
of Lisbon excluded the horses, as thinking
it irreverent that the Real Presence should
be preceded by unreasonable creatures. St.
George’s charger alone was excepted from the
prohibition; but in the midst of the procession
that charger suddenly stopped, and could neither
be induced nor compelled to proceed; it was not
doubted that the rider had chosen this means to
manifest his displeasure at the privation of his
accustomed train; the Archbishop revoked his
order upon the spot, and when the horses were
introduced as usual, St. George consented to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
move forward, and the ceremony of the day was
concluded with more than wonted satisfaction.
The profane Mordomo, however, was not forgiven;
on the following Sunday, when he was
saying mass at the saint’s altar, St. George let

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mappa de Portugal, t. ii. 257.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

his spear drop from his hand upon the offender’s
head.</p>

<p>The image which performed this miracle, after
appearing annually in the procession during more
than 350 years, was destroyed by fire at the time
of the great earthquake. A new one, however,
had been substituted, which succeeded to all the
honours and miraculous properties of its predecessor.
One of the finest horses which could
be found in Portugal was selected to bear the
saint in the great procession, and reserved for
that single purpose, as if any other would have
desecrated it. Junot, however, had taken St.
George’s horse for himself, and rode it every
Sunday when he reviewed his troops. And this
year, for the first time, St. George was not to
bear a part in the pageant: the reason which
the French assigned for excluding him was, that
he could not appear with his usual splendour,
because the jewels of the Cadaval family, which
he always wore in his hat on that day, had been
taken to Brazil when the court emigrated. Other
motives were imagined by the Portugueze: when
the saint returned, after the fatigues of the day,
a royal present had always been allotted him; it
was thought that the French wished to spare
themselves this expense. They were carrying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
on works within the circuit of the castle which
were designed to command the city, and render
the place defensible against the English and the
Portugueze themselves; these works were carried
on secretly, but it was part of the ceremony
that St. George should enter the castle, and in
that case his retinue would have observed what

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 257.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was going on. Lastly, the people said that the
French did not choose to let St. George go into
public because he was an English saint.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The procession interrupted by a panic fear.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In all other things Junot wished the Lisboners
to see that the spectacle had lost nothing of its
wonted splendour. The procession had performed
half its course when a sudden alarm arose, occasioned,
it is said, by a thief, who being detected
in some petty larceny, cried out, in the hope of
exciting confusion and effecting his escape, that
the English were crossing the bar. A general
tumult ensued; some of the French formed as if
expecting immediately to be attacked, ... others
hurried to their posts with a celerity which was
absurdly attributed to fear instead of promptitude;
a crowd rushed into the church of S. Domingos
for sanctuary, from whence the chapter
of the patriarchal church were just about to proceed
with the pix, in which the Romish mystery
of impanation, the object of that day’s superstition,
was contained. Some of the insignia which
were to form a part of the show were thrown
down and broken in the rush, and the clergy
hastened to secure themselves each where he
could. Not the mob alone, but the persons who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
were to form the procession, priests, monks, ministers,
and knights, in the habiliments of their
orders, took to flight; communities and brotherhoods
forsook their banners and their crosses;
here and there only an aged friar or sacristan
was seen in whom the sense of devotion was
stronger than fear, and who remained in his place,
thinking that if he were now to die, it were best
to perish at his station and in his duty. Wherever
a door was open, the terrified people ran in, as
if flying from an actual massacre; the great
streets and the Rocio were presently deserted,
and the pavement was strewn with hats, cloaks,
and shoes, lost in the confusion. Fewer accidents
occurred than might have been expected
in such a scene; the alarm abated when it was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 306.
<br />
Neves, iii. 256–262.
<br />
Thiebault, 122–124.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

ascertained that the British fleet was not entering;
and when the cause of the<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>disturbance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
was discovered, the broken parts of the procession
were brought together as soon as possible,
and Junot with his generals closed it, in place of
the Prince Regent and his court.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junot fortifies the castle.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Though the tidings of the insurrection at Porto
had soon been followed by news that submission
had been restored in that city, intelligence of
insurrectionary movements or designs was now
arriving every day, and Junot thought it necessary
to take farther precautions for holding
Lisbon in subjection. The water-carriers were
employed to fill the cisterns in the Castle, which
was now strongly fortified; stores and fodder were
laid in there, it was garrisoned with 800 men, and
all the swords and small arms from the arsenal

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 24.</span>
Edict for disarming the people.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were removed thither. An edict was issued commanding
all persons to deliver up their fire-arms,
swords, and hunting-spears, those Portugueze
alone whose legal privilege it was to wear a sword
being allowed still to retain one. If within forty-eight
hours after the publication of that edict
arms should be found in the possession of a Portugueze,
he was to be imprisoned, and fined according
to his means from 100 franks to 1000
cruzados; if the offender were a native of Great
Britain, and delayed obedience half the time, his
fine was to be from 100 cruzados to 10,000, and
greater punishment inflicted if the case required
it: for other foreigners the same time was appointed
as for the natives, and the extent of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 314.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

their fine was to be 2000 cruzados, but, like the
English, they were liable to any farther punishment
which the French might think proper to inflict.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
It was the custom in Portugal, as formerly
in England, to celebrate the eve of certain
festivals, and especially those of St. John the
Baptist, and St. Peter, with bonfires: the custom
of kindling festal fires at that season of the year
is as old as the worship of the Kelts, even perhaps
before their entrance into Europe; and it
is one of the many pagan rites which Romish
Christianity adopted. The use of gunpowder
made it a dangerous custom even among a people
so little addicted to mischief as the Portugueze:
and at the pretended desire of certain pious persons,
who deemed such rejoicings incompatible
with that calm and collected state of mind which
the church required at such times, all these demonstrations
of festivity were prohibited. Any
person letting off fire-works or fire-arms, as had
been usual, making any use of gunpowder, or
kindling a bonfire, was to be imprisoned eight
days, and pay a fine proportioned to his means:
parents were made answerable for their children,
schoolmasters for their boys, masters for their
servants, tradesmen for those in their employ;
the public walk was not to be open in the evening,
and any concourse of people in the streets
was forbidden. Orders were given to clear the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 311.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Campo de Ourique immediately, though the
crops were not ripe, that troops might be encamped
there, from whence, and from the Castle,
the city would be completely under their command.
Detachments were sent north and south
to keep down a people, who were now everywhere<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
beginning to manifest their long suppressed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 317.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

indignation. The men marched out of
Lisbon with provisions and kettles upon their
backs, and each with a loaf fixed upon his
bayonet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements at Braga.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The news of the first insurrection at Porto
produced considerable effect in the north of
Portugal before it was known that that city,
through the treachery or timidity of the persons
in power, had again submitted to the intrusive
government. At Braga the Archbishop gave
orders for taking the cover from the royal arms
upon his palace, and reciting in the service the
collect for the Prince Regent and Royal Family.
The restoration of the legitimate government
was proclaimed by the better part of the people;
but the public performance of that duty was prevented
by some of those persons who are to be
found in all countries, whose sole object is to advance
themselves, they care not by what means.
They, putting their trust in Buonaparte and his

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 124–6.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

fortune, drew up formal charges against the primate,
and dispatched them to Junot. Had the
French remained masters of Portugal, this process
would have terminated in his deposition,
perhaps in his death; ... but the fire was now
spreading on all sides, and breaking out, as in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Melgaço.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Spain, every where, simultaneously. A Galician
gentleman, by name Mosqueira de Lira, having
concerted measures at the house of his brother-in-law,
who was an inhabitant of Melgaço, with
the Corregedor of that place, and with a retired<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
magistrate, entered the town with some other
Galicians of the border and their armed followers,
on a day when the people from the adjacent
country were assembled there at a fair.
Encouraged by their appearance, the Portugueze
broke out into execrations against Napoleon
and his instruments, and proclaimed their lawful
Prince. The Quinas, which, during the usurpation,
had been covered upon all public buildings
and monuments where they had not been destroyed,
were presently exposed again to the
eyes of a people whose belief it was that Christ
himself had in person commanded the founder
of their monarchy to bear upon his shield those

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 9.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

symbols of his passion. The next day the acclamation
was performed with the same formalities as
at the commencement of a new reign, the magistrates
and persons in office taking the lead; and
the joyful inhabitants sallied out to indulge
their overflowing loyalty by repeating the scene
in the neighbouring villages. Their hilarity was
interrupted by a sudden report that a French
army had landed on the coast of Galicia, and
that a corps of that army had already arrived
at Caniza, meaning to cross the Minho, and attack
Melgaço. That town had been founded by the
first King of Portugal, and refortified by King
Diniz: his works had long since fallen to decay,
and the place was open to an enemy. The bells
rang the alarm, and the people, resolving rather
to meet the danger than to wait for it, set off
with two pieces of cannon, tumultuously, and in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
that state of heated spirits and insubordination
which such calamitous times produce. The falsehood
of the report was soon ascertained; a fellow
then boldly proposed that they should nevertheless
march forward and collect forces, and because
the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Capitam Mor</i> ordered the countrymen to return
peaceably to their homes, this man attempted
to pistol him; the mischief was prevented by a
resolute and right-minded peasant, who seized
the ruffian and threw him to the ground. Other
indications of the disposition in the populace to
abuse their power as soon as they feel it, soon
appeared. A rumour went about that the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juiz
de fora</i> had struck the red flag which had been
planted in the town; a tumultuous sentence of
death was passed upon him, and a party set out
to execute it. But when they approached the
town they saw the flag still flying: it was however
true that the Juiz had been advised to strike
it, because, if the French arrived, the sight of the
bloody flag might provoke them to put all to the
sword. The advice was given by an officer, and
with no ill intention, for no man exerted himself
more actively: but his military prudence on this
occasion had well nigh cost him his life, and
he only escaped by the swiftness of his horse.
Warned by these indications how dangerous any
act would be which the people could interpret
into an intention of intimidating them or checking
their ardour, the Juiz, when he received
Junot’s proclamation, communicated it to none
but those on whom he could rely; he prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
for action as well as the means of the place would
afford, and applied to the Junta of Orense for
assistance in men, arms, and ammunition. Some
troops accordingly were sent by them to Milmanda
and Cellanova, whence they might enter

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 126–135.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Portugal to assist Melgaço, whenever their assistance
was required.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Prince Regent proclaimed at Braganza.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the national feeling was thus displayed
in one of the remotest corners of the kingdom,
similar scenes occurred in places of more importance,
and more exposed to the vengeance
of the enemy. The post-office in the city of
Braganza was at the house of the Abbot of Carrazedo.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

A letter brought him news of the insurrection
at Porto; he read it aloud to the persons
who happened to be present; their letters
confirmed the welcome tidings, and added the
flattering expectation that by that time Junot
would have been made prisoner at Lisbon.
Readily believing what they wished, they set
up a shout of rejoicing; the news spread; the
multitude joined in exulting acclamations, and
the parties from the post-office hastened to a
church, where the governor of the province,
General Manoel Jorge Gomes de Sepulveda,
was attending a service in honour of St. Antonio.
This general, though oppressed with age
and infirmities, hesitated not as to the course
which he should pursue. He left the church to
issue such orders as were expedient without
delay. The bells of the cathedral were ordered
to strike up, and those of all the churches joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
presently in expressing and heightening the
public joy. There were, however, men in authority
who had no generous hopes or feelings
to mislead their judgement on this occasion; and
they, like others of the same stamp at Braga,
thinking to obtain favour with the intrusive government,
hastened to the general, and asked
him what was the meaning of all this stir. Sepulveda
took them to the window, and showed them
the streets swarming with people, who were crying
out, The Prince and the Royal House of
Braganza for ever! the General for ever! Down
with the French! “There,” said he, “you hear
what is the meaning; ... and you may quiet
that multitude if you dare.” He illuminated his
house, which was the signal for a general illumination:
he ordered such arms as were in the city
to be made ready for service, sent to Chaves for
more, offered pardon to deserters upon their
repairing to Braganza, called upon all reduced
officers to come forward, and issued orders to
all the governors and <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Capitaens mores</i> within
his jurisdiction to proclaim their lawful Prince,
and enrol the peasantry for the service of their

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 136–141.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

country. A solemn mass was celebrated the next
day in the cathedral as a thanksgiving service, a
sermon was preached upon the occasion, and all
who were present mounted the national cockade,
the clergy wearing it upon the breast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Braganzans intimidated by the news from Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These festive days were of short duration. The
next post, which was expected to confirm the promises
of the last, and bring news of Junot’s overthrow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
and capture, arrived with intelligence that
all was tranquil at Lisbon, and that Porto had
returned to subjection. It brought also circular
letters from the French government, requiring
the Portugueze to continue in obedience, and
threatening severe vengeance to all who should
disturb the public tranquillity. The danger was
now deemed as imminent as the triumph had
before seemed certain. Loison would hasten
from Almeida to punish Braganza for its revolt;
and Marshal Bessieres also, they thought, was
about to descend upon them from Castille. The
time-servers now obtained an ascendancy, and
were about to draw up a formal accusation
against Sepulveda, and the persons who had
taken the lead in this precipitate insurrection.
They proposed to him, however, that he should
join with them in a representation soliciting
pardon for the city, saying that all which had
been done, had been submitted to by him because
it was not possible at that moment to oppose
the populace, and that the illuminations and
other demonstrations of joy were only in honour
of St. Antonio. Letters were accordingly written
to this effect. Sepulveda’s object was to gain
time by dissimulation, while he took measures
for securing a retreat into Spain, unless affairs
in Portugal should take a fortunate turn; and
while he let the promoters of this submission

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 141–146.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

send his letter with their own to the post-office,
he secretly instructed the post-master not to
forward it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second insurrection at Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>As the first declaration of the people at Porto
had occasioned these movements in the north
of Portugal, so these secondary movements, reported
and exaggerated in like manner, re-acted
upon the public spirit in that city. Oliveira,
who had acted under fear of the French, was
now in fear of his own countrymen, and soon
found himself in such a situation, that he was in
danger of being regarded as an enemy by both.
On the day of the Corpo de Deos he wished the
soldiers to carry the French eagles in the procession
instead of the national banner, and this
they resolutely refused to do; the end was, that
only a few companies, without any colours, appeared
in the train. The temper of the people
was shown at this time by the groups which
collected in the streets, and the agitation which
every countenance expressed. Raymundo, consulting
at once his own safety, and the furtherance
of his country’s cause, had conveyed letters
to the city, dated from Vianna and from Valença,
saying that he was on his way to Spain, there to
solicit succours, with which he should presently
return: and the ignorant people, ready to believe
any thing, were fully persuaded that he
would soon appear at the head of a Spanish

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 97.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

army. A report, with more appearance but as
little reality of truth, accelerated the success of
his stratagem, though it was intended to intimidate
the people. The <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juiz de fora</i> at Oliveira
de Azemeis received orders to provide rations
for a French detachment on the way from Coimbra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
to Porto. It was part of Junot’s policy to
alarm the people by such reports, for the purpose
of keeping them in submission. The means
of that place were not equal to the sudden demand;
the Juiz represented this to the governor
of Porto, and bread was ordered from that city,
in obedience to the requisition. A few Frenchmen,
who had concealed themselves during the
first insurrection, and re-appeared when Oliveira
restored the usurped authority, imprudently assisted
in loading the carts with loaves for this
purpose; a crowd collected at the sight, burning
with indignation; a native Portugueze artilleryman
remarked, that bread enough could be found
for the French, though not for the Portugueze;
one of the Frenchmen returned an answer which

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 163–168.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

provoked a blow; the mob immediately took
part, seized the French, and delivered them to
a guard of soldiers, who took charge of them,
without knowing for what end, or inquiring by
whose authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Formation of a Junta in that city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This second insurrection had been prepared,
though the occasion upon which it broke out
was accidental. The Portugueze flag was displayed,
Joam Manoel de Mariz brought out from
the barracks at Santo Ovidio four field-pieces
ready for service, with thirty artillerymen to
serve them; the arsenal was opened, and arms
and cartridges distributed to all who applied for
them. And Raymundo, who had concealed himself
in a country-house only two miles from Porto,
made his appearance by the convent of S. Domingos,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
with nineteen Spaniards, armed with
blunderbusses like himself, and covered with
dust, and with their cloaks upon their backs, like
men arriving from a long march. They declared
that a Spanish army was on the way, and the
people, in full expectation of this support, prepared
to defend the city against the French.
Some guns were placed upon the bridge, others
on the heights of Villa-nova. There was some
difficulty in conveying them to the latter position;
a Dominican, who had sallied from his convent
sword in hand, and with his sleeves tucked up,
laid hold of the ropes; friars, priests, and women,
followed his example, and the work was presently
accomplished. While they were thus exerting
themselves to provide for the defence of the city,
the rabble exercised their authority in the usual
way, discharging fire-arms in the streets, beating
drums, blowing trumpets, ordering the bells to
be rung in all the churches and convents, breaking
open houses to search for Frenchmen and
suspected persons. They threw Oliveira and
many others into prison, but happily no murders
were committed. The mob were restrained in
their ferocity by the expectation that traitors
would be brought to condign punishment as soon
as the lawful authority was re-established, which
it soon would be. Till that time it was resolved
that a local and provisional government should
be formed after the manner of the Spaniards.
The authors of the movement had concerted
this, and fixed upon persons to constitute the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
Junta; but while they were engaged in the ceremony
of nominating and appointing them, a report
arrived that the French were actually at
Grijo, within twelve miles of Porto. The question
then was, should they wait upon the defensive
on the heights of Villa-nova, or hasten
to attack them, in the hope of surprising them
by night, and finding them exhausted by a long
march? The bolder opinion prevailed; and a
volunteer party set off for Grijo, and hurried
there so fast, that they would have been in worse
condition, as well as worse order, than the enemy,
if any enemy had been there. But instead of
the French they found a few travellers on the
way from Coimbra, who assured them that there
was no rumour of the advance of any troops
along the road. Even a victory would hardly
have elevated their spirits more. This was about
daybreak; they hastened back to the city. The

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 19.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

soldiers in the Campo de S. Ovidio swore upon
their swords to defend the independence of
Portugal, their religion, and their King. A
public meeting was convoked, the bells of the
chamber rung, the soldiers led the way in military
order, with two field-pieces; the people followed
to the episcopal palace; the Bishop came forth
into the varanda, and gave the assembled multitude
his blessing; then he descended among
them, kissed their banner, and led the way to
the cathedral, there to implore the divine assistance
in their meritorious undertaking. This
done, they returned to the palace, and proceeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
to appoint what they called the Provisional Junta
of Supreme Government; the list which had
been prepared was shortened, as being inconveniently
numerous; eight members were appointed,
in equal numbers, from the clergy, the
magistracy, the military, and the citizens, and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 169–176.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the Bishop was placed at their head with the
title of President Governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures of the Junta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Bishop, D. Antonio de S. José e Castro,
immediately published a manifesto, in the name
of the Prince Regent, declaring that the French
Government was abolished and exterminated in
that country, and the royal authority restored
and to be exercised plenarily and independently
by the Provisional Junta of Porto, till the government
instituted by his Royal Highness should be
re-established. The Junta therefore gave orders,
that in all places the Prince should be proclaimed,
and the royal arms uncovered and respected as
heretofore they always had been, and now again
hereafter were to be; and they called upon all
constituted authorities to act accordingly. His
next business was to dispatch a messenger to
General Sepulveda at Braganza, requesting succours,
especially in cavalry, and an officer capable
of taking the command, whether for attack or
defence. The Visconde de Balsamam was sent
to the British brig, which was still hovering off
the bar, and a communication was thus opened
with England. Voluntary contributions were
liberally made, the pay of the soldiers was raised,
and as a measure not less popular, a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Tribunal de<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Inconfidencia</i> was instituted, to take cognizance
of causes in which treason was suspected. The
prevalence of suspicion is indeed one of the
many dreadful evils in such calamitous times.
An example of this occurred before the close of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrest of Cardoso.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the day. Colonel José Cardoso de Menezes
Soutomaior had been that day appointed to the
chief command, as being the senior officer. Happening
to send a messenger that evening with
letters upon public business to the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juizes de
fora</i> at Oliveira de Azemeis and Recardaens, he
forgot to provide him with the passport which
was now necessary for crossing the bridge. The
messenger was therefore stopped by the guards,
and either from the confusion occasioned by fear,
or from a confidence of protection, refused to
declare whither he was going, or by whom he
was sent. Upon this the guards searched him,
and found the two letters. These would have
explained the matter and cleared him; but perceiving
that a third letter which he carried more
secretly about his person was in danger of being
found, he drew it out, tore it in pieces with his
teeth, and threw it over the bridge. A few
fragments were saved, but not enough to give
any indication of its contents. The messenger
was immediately arrested as a traitor, and carried
before José Cardoso, who thought at first to end
the business by desiring that the man might be
left with him, and saying that he would answer
for him. The people (for a crowd had collected
on the way) transferred at this their suspicions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
upon Cardoso himself; and to satisfy them, he
found it necessary to open the two letters, and
thus acquaint the mob with arrangements which
it had not been intended that they should know.
But he could give no account of the paper which
had been torn; and therefore the mob, having
thrown his messenger into prison, returned to
arrest him and carry him before the Bishop. Protestations
of innocence were vain, and it was
evident that his life would be in danger on the
way; some of his friends, however, bethought
themselves of a happy stratagem; they rung the
alarm bells, and raised a cry that the enemy was
approaching. Evening was now closing; the
populace left their intended victim to go in quest
of the invaders, and passed the night in hurrying
here and there upon the false report. Cardoso
meantime got in safety to the Bishop’s
palace, and related all that had passed. As far
as he was concerned his justification was clear,
but of the third letter he could give no account.
The messenger, however, gave a plain and credible
one; he had not long since been at Lisbon,
where a Frenchman had given him this letter for
one of his countrymen in Porto; on his arrival
in that city he found that the person to whom
it was addressed had been carried away prisoner
by the Spaniards; and his intention was, when
he returned to Lisbon, to deliver it again to the
writer. He had torn it in a moment of fear, lest
he should be considered a partizan and agent of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii, 186–192.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the French, if it were found upon him. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
Bishop was satisfied; but he advised Cardoso
not to appear in public till this unlucky accident
should be forgotten.</p>

<p>About noon, on the ensuing day, the alarm
bells were rung again, drums beat, trumpets
sounded, and preparations were again made for
an immediate engagement with the enemy. They
were at Os Carvalhos, it was said, eight miles
off. There was some foundation for this report.
The Juiz at Oliveira de Azemeis was in expectation
and fear of the French, and not having received
the bread from Porto which he had been
ordered to have in readiness for them, had sent
to this town and to the adjacent villages, to embargo
all that could be found. Troops and volunteers
now hurried forward with the utmost
alacrity, and in the utmost disorder. This was
a critical moment for Cardoso: if he went abroad,
to put himself at the head of the forces, as his
duty required, there was the risk of being again
accused and endangered as a traitor: if, on the
other hand, he forbore to appear, the very forbearance
would be interpreted as a proof of disaffection
to his country. After some hours of
indecision, he could not bear to remain inactive,
and incur the reproach to which it must needs
subject him at such a time, and forth he went.
He had not gone far before a poor fellow, whom
a party of <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Ordenanças</i> upon some suspicion had
seized, met him, and implored his protection.
Cardoso inquired into the case, and finding the
man innocent, gave orders to release him. His<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
authority was disputed, and presently he himself
was reproached and seized as a traitor. Some
were for putting him to death upon the spot;
and though others insisted upon carrying him
before the Bishop, it appeared very doubtful
whether he would reach the palace alive. When
they met a priest upon the way, the mob called
upon him to confess this traitor, who was about
to die, and Cardoso himself cried out for absolution,
seeing nothing but death before his eyes.
The Bishop was convinced of his innocence, but
could neither persuade the populace, nor command
them; nor could he save Cardoso’s life by
any other expedient than that of allowing him
to be thrown into one of the worst dungeons of
a Portugueze prison. In that miserable confinement

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 192–196.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

he remained till the heat of these tumults
had abated; he was then released, and honourably
distinguished himself afterwards.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disturbed state of the people.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meantime Porto was in a frightful state of
insubordination. The people readily enrolled
themselves, but, as if intoxicated with joy, they
celebrated their deliverance instead of labouring
to secure it: and men who ought to have been
practising the drill, or erecting batteries and
throwing up trenches, were beating drums, ringing
the bells, and wasting powder in empty demonstrations
of bravery. The city was illuminated
during three successive nights, and they
seemed so little aware of the tremendous conflict
in which they were engaged, that they were
about to march to war as to a festival. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
this delusion the Bishop roused them by an appeal
well adapted to those for whom it was intended.
“Portugueze,” he said, “in the name
of Heaven and of Jesus Christ, listen to a government
which loves you, which desires your
happiness, and is labouring for it! Their turbulence,
he told them, their insubordination,
their waste of powder, only exposed them to the
enemy, who would come upon them by surprise,
and surely destroy them, if they would not listen
to their rulers and obey orders. Strength without
order was like the bull, who, strong as he is,
is brought to the ground by a weak hand, with
the aid of dexterity and a cloak. Their endeavour
should be to be unseen and unheard,
that they might the more fatally be felt; ... to
conceal their movements, that they might strike
when the blow was not expected. The government
conjured them, by every thing which was
most sacred in heaven and earth, to subject
themselves to discipline, and obey their officers.
Where they were posted there they were adjured
to remain till the time for action arrived: they
who were first in the field would diminish the
number of the enemy when they engaged them;
the second body, when they arrived, would weaken
the French still farther; the third would complete
their destruction. But if all hurried on
tumultuously, all would be lost.” The populace
by this time had fired away so much powder, and
spent so much of their animal spirits in rioting,
and hurrying here and there upon so many false<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
alarms, that they were disposed to listen to this
advice. Tranquillity was produced by exhaustion;
and to preserve it, order was given that
the alarm bells should not be rung till the cathedral

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 196–198.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

began, and that whenever that was necessary,
a flag should be hoisted on the tower by
day, and a torch by night, to distinguish it from
the fire-bell.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Junta conclude an alliance with the Junta of Galicia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Subordination being now in some degree restored,
the Junta entered with alacrity upon
their arduous duties. They raised a loan, and
imposed new taxes, as the exigencies of the time
required; among others a duty of four <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">mil reis</i>
upon every pipe of wine which was exported.
Two deputies were sent to England; and an
alliance was concluded with the Supreme Junta
of Galicia, the nearest of the newly constituted
authorities in Spain; Galicia engaging first to
assist in liberating Portugal, and Portugal promising,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 199.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

after her own deliverance should be accomplished,
to co-operate in expelling the French
from every part of the Peninsula. Wild as this
promise appeared to the French, and to those
shallow statesmen by whom the French were
regarded as invincible, and the power of Buonaparte
not to be resisted, it was faithfully performed
by the Portugueze, and fulfilled to the
letter of the bond. The Junta of Porto had another
object to accomplish, more difficult, and
at that time not less important, than an alliance
with Spain. Other Juntas were now springing
up in the north of Portugal at the first hope of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
deliverance, and unless these were induced to
acknowledge that at Porto as supreme, all plans
of defence would be frustrated by the jealousy of
contending authorities. One had been formed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Its authority is acknowledged throughout the north of Portugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

at Viana on the same day; others at Torre de
Moncorvo, Miranda, and other places of less
note; all these submitted readily to the superiority
which was claimed. Braganza was not so willing
to resign its pretensions. The intrusive government
had not been re-established in that city,
notwithstanding the efforts of its adherents, and
the apparent assent of General Sepulveda. Their
penitent letters to the French ministry were
stopped at Villa Real, where the people proclaimed
their lawful Prince; and when the Braganzans,
upon tidings of the second insurrection
at Porto, formed a Junta, and required obedience
to its edicts, its authority was disowned there.
Sepulveda was so offended at this, that he sent
Brigadier Manoel Pinto Bacellar to arrest Francisco
da Silveira Pinto da Fonseca, then a lieutenant-colonel
of cavalry, who had taken the lead
at Villa Real. Bacellar acted with more prudence
than the general who sent him, and endeavoured
by amicable means to bring about a good understanding;
and Silveira, disregarding the orders
of one who had so far been found wanting, that
he had at least professed submission to the French
after having once thrown off their yoke, crossed
the Douro, to spread the revolution in the province
of Beira. Sepulveda found as little obedience
in Torre de Moncorvo and some other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Juntas in that district, when he issued a circular
order requiring that every town which was entitled
to a voice in the Cortes should send a
deputy to assist at the provincial Junta of Tras
os Montes, the title which that of Braganza had
assumed. Opposed in their pretensions on that
side, after contesting the authority of the Porto
Junta, concluding a treaty with it, and then
again disputing with it, and arraigning its measures,
the Junta of Braganza ended at length in

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 151–162. 180–185.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

obeying the advice of the Bishop of Porto, which
was repeated in strong terms by Sepulveda, and
dissolving itself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The insurrection extends towards Coimbra.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The whole of Tras os Montes and of the province
between the rivers had now declared
against the intrusive government, and acknowledged
the Junta of Porto. The same spirit was
spreading in Beira. Aveiro declared itself, and
a plan was formed for surprising the French in
Coimbra, an undertaking of more importance
than danger. The details are curious, as showing
the disposition of the people, the insignificance
of their means, and the disorderly manner
of their proceedings. A patrole of armed peasants
had been sent out from Porto upon the
Coimbra road, to obtain intelligence of the enemy,
concerning whom nothing certain was known.
Dr. José Bernardo de Azevedo, of the order of
Avis, hearing upon what service these persons
had been sent, represented to the Junta how
little likely it was that such a set of men should
act with discretion; upon the first news of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
enemy they would hurry back without ascertaining
their numbers, position, and probable movements;
or if they ventured to approach them,
would most probably fall into their hands. He

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

offered to obtain the desired information himself,
knowing the country well, and accordingly laying
aside his habit, set off with one servant on
horseback. When he arrived at Oliveira de
Azemeis, he met the greater part of the patrole
on their return in triumph; they had failed to
arrest the Juiz as they intended, but they had
caught a lawyer, and were dragging him to Porto
as a suspected person. They had however sent
four of their party forward on the Coimbra road,
in pursuance of their original object, and José
Bernardo proceeding on his journey, overtook
them at Mealhada, a village about twelve miles
from Coimbra. Exulting that they had advanced
so far without meeting the French, and encouraged
by what they heard from the people of
Mealhada, that the enemy had only a handful of
men in Coimbra, and most of them invalided,
they resolved to fall upon them, by surprise if
possible, that very day. A reformed colonel of
militia at Ois undertook to bring thirty armed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 200–205.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

men; the people of Mealhada volunteered their
services, and the two parties were to meet at
Carquejo, half way on their march.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Scheme for surprising the enemy in Coimbra.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When the men of Mealhada began to prepare
for their expedition, there were some whose
hearts failed them, and the contagion spread.
José Bernardo, however, by reproaching and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
threatening some, encouraging and praising
others, with the seasonable administration of
fruit and wine, and the zealous help of a serjeant
of the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Ordenança</i>, mustered some thirty
peasants, with about twenty muskets, the rest
were armed with pikes and sickles and other
such instruments; and when they set off many
of the others followed, ashamed to be left behind.
The party from Ois not having arrived
when they reached Carquejo, José Bernardo
ordered his people to halt for them there, and
suffer no person to pass toward Coimbra, while
he and two others went on to reconnoitre and
form the plan of attack. He found no difficulty
in entering the city and obtaining all the information
he desired. The French soldiers in
Coimbra did not amount to an hundred men,
and of these not more than forty were capable
of service. There was a rumour that 1200
Spaniards were on the way against them. This
the inhabitants were more likely to believe
than the French, who, relying upon their Emperor’s
fortune, the terror of the French name,
and the submission of the Portugueze, were
living to all appearance in full confidence of
security. Satisfied with this intelligence, and
without venturing to concert any co-operation
in the city, José Bernardo returned as far as the
Bridge of Agua de Maias, and sent to hasten
the march of his motley volunteers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French in that city are made prisoners.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When they were not far from this bridge, they
were seen by a patrole of four horsemen, two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
French and two Portugueze, who clapped spurs
to their horses, in order to cross the bridge before
them and give the alarm. The insurgents,
however, equally on the alert, got between them
and the bridge, and addressed them with the
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">quem vive</i>? Napoleon, was the answer, and two
pistols were fired upon them without effect. A
general discharge was returned, which killed two
of the patrole and mortally wounded another.
The fourth, who escaped unhurt, was a Portugueze;
he threw himself off his horse, cried out,
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Viva o Principe de Portugal!</i> and joined his
countrymen. The wounded man was a Frenchman:
the insurgents, with a humanity not to
have been expected at such a moment, left one
of their number to assist him, and he was afterwards
removed into the city, and there humanely
and carefully attended; but to his latest breath
he reviled the Portugueze, and the last hope
which he expressed was, that ample vengeance
would be taken for his blood. The French guard
at the gate of S. Sophia hearing the guns, and
seeing a number of men approach, fired among
them, and fled to their quarters in the College
of S. Thomas. The Portugueze followed close:
they were fired upon from the windows without
effect, for the French were too sensible of their
own weakness to make any regular defence; the
doors were forced, and they quietly laid down
their arms, and suffered themselves to be bound,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 207–212.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

happy to receive no worse treatment from such
an assemblage, ... for by this time the whole rabble
of Coimbra had collected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Juiz do Povo takes the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Having thus easily succeeded, the first thought
of José Bernardo and his comrades was to obtain
the sanction and assistance of some legal authority
for their future proceedings. The courage,
and perhaps the disposition, of the magistrates
was doubted; but the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juiz do Povo</i> was an officer
whom tumultuous times had heretofore forced
into importance, and the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juiz do Povo</i> was now
called for. José Pedro de Jesus, a cooper by
trade, who held the office, happened to possess
a rare union of upright character, activity, and
good sense. He came forward, assumed a power
which was willingly recognized, and exercised it
in a manner which at once gratified the populace
and satisfied the wishes of cooler minds. First
he lodged the French safely in prison, then distributed
among the people the arms of those
cavalry regiments belonging to the northern
provinces, which Junot had disbanded. In the
depôt with these weapons a flag was found with
the royal arms. It was carried in triumph through
the streets, while the exulting people hastened to
uncover the shield of Portugal upon the public
buildings. The bells from all the colleges and
convents and churches of that populous city
pealed in with the acclamations of the people,
and heightened the excitement and agitation of
their spirits. Bonfires were kindled, as in old
times, in defiance of Junot’s prohibition: the
night of St. John’s had always been a festival in
Coimbra, but never before had it been celebrated
with such uproar and overflowing joy. Some
barks on the river, laden with provisions for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
the French in Figueira, were seized during the
night; and in the morning it was deemed prudent
to march off the prisoners to Porto, under
a strong escort, lest the magistracy, in their fear,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 214–217.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

should release them, and again reduce the city
to submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Order restored in Coimbra.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This apprehension, however, was ill founded.
The <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Juiz de fora</i> came forward to act in the
national cause; the students and lecturers formed
themselves into an academical corps; and the
Vice-Rector of the university, Manoel Paes de
Aragam Trigoso, took upon himself the civil
authority, in compliance with the wish of the inhabitants.
They would have vested the military
command in General Bernardim Freire de Andrade,
whom the Prince, before his departure
for Brazil, had appointed to the command at
Porto. Not choosing to exercise it under the
intrusive government, he was living privately
at Coimbra; but being now summoned by the
Bishop and Junta of Porto to his proper station,
he declined for that reason the present nomination.
The people next thought of D. Miguel
Pereira Forjas, but he chose rather to follow
Bernardim as his quarter-master general. They
then chose Bernardim’s brother, Nuno Freire de
Andrade, making him, however, subordinate to
Trigoso. The men who thus accepted offices of
authority discharged a most perilous duty to their
country. They were not, like their countrymen in
Tras os Montes and between the rivers, secured
in some degree by distance from the French, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
within reach of assistance from Spain, or, if need
were, of an asylum in that kingdom. Nor would
Coimbra be like some of the smaller towns, overlooked
as unworthy of vengeance. Next to the
capital itself there was no place in Portugal where
a terrible example would so deeply impress and
intimidate the nation: it was within easy reach
of the enemy, from Almeida as well as from
Lisbon, and all military means of defence were

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 219–223.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

wanting: a few pounds of powder were all that
could be found in the city, and not one piece of
cannon.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for defence.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the other hand, more talents and enterprise,
such as the times required, might reasonably
be expected in Coimbra than in any other
of the Portugueze towns. It was a populous
and flourishing university, the only one in the
kingdom: here therefore the flower of the Portugueze
youth would be found, just at that age
when they would be most willing and fit for
service; and of that rank, and in that place,
where national and generous feelings would
have their strongest influence. If any where
heads to plan and hands to execute might be
found, it would be here. Accordingly no exertions
were wanting. Chemists made gunpowder,
geometricians directed works of defence, old soldiers
were employed, some in making cartridges,
others in training volunteers; mechanics were

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 223–225.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

set to work in whatever manner they might be
most useful; bridges were broken down, roads
broken up, means made ready for defending the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
streets, if the enemy should enter the city, and
a strict police established.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Successful expedition against Figueira.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When one day had been passed in these arrangements
and preparations an expedition was
planned against Figueira da Foz, a small town
and fort at the mouth of the Mondego, on the
right bank, seven leagues from Coimbra. The
French had a garrison of an hundred men there.
Forty volunteers, who were almost all students,
under the command of Bernardo Antonio Zagalo,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

a student also, set out at evening, in hope
of capturing this important point: they relied
upon increasing their numbers on the way, and
they took with them authority from the governor
to raise the country as they went. Zagalo, with
four horsemen, took the right bank, the rest of
the party the left: they met at Montemor o
Velho, and marching all night, appeared with
the reinforcements which they had gathered,
now some 3000 in number, before Figueira, at
seven in the morning. The enemy were taken
by surprise; they were dispersed about the
town, when they saw this multitude approach;
but immediately retiring into the fort, they prepared
for defence. The place might have been
easily defended against a crowd of peasants, more
of whom were armed with pikes and reaping-hooks
than with fowling-pieces, and who were
likely, upon the slightest loss or disgust, to
abandon their enterprise as precipitately as they
had engaged in it. But the French, relying too
confidently upon the submission of the Portugueze,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
had neglected to store the fort with provisions;
and Zagalo summoned them, saying he
knew they had not food for more than four-and-twenty
hours, and that if they did not surrender
they should all be put to the sword. Contrary
to his usual policy, Junot had given the command
of this fort to a Portugueze lieutenant of
engineers; this person demurred at surrendering,
because his family were at Peniche, in the power
of the French. But, wanting either the will or
the ability to exert himself in the enemy’s service,
he remained inactive and confounded, till
the following day, when Zagalo received positive
orders from Coimbra to return immediately with
all his people. This enabled the commander to
obtain terms which might be pleaded to save his
credit; and he capitulated on condition that the
garrison should be allowed to cross the river with
their arms and knapsacks, but without powder
and ball; and to march unmolested to Peniche,
the nearest strong place in possession of the
French. Upon these terms the fort was given
up; but the peasantry searched the men when
they were embarking, and finding that some of
them had concealed a few cartridges, declared
that the conditions were broken: they themselves
were desirous of breaking them, and
therefore gladly found this pretext; and the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 226–233.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

French would have been massacred if the students
had not exerted themselves to protect
them, and lodged them safely as prisoners at
Coimbra.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison ordered to march from Almeida to Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A report of Loison’s sudden approach had
occasioned the order for recalling Zagalo. General
Count Loison had been sent in the latter
end of May, with 4000 troops, to Almeida, in
pursuance of positive and repeated instructions
from Murat when exercising the command in
Madrid. He was to concert his movements with
Bessieres, and, if necessary, to join him; he was to
observe Salamanca, and secure Ciudad Rodrigo,
if that were practicable. But the Spaniards were
too much awakened to be again deceived or surprised
by the French; and Loison having remained
at Almeida from the 5th of June till the
16th, received orders from Junot to march upon
Porto, take the command in that city, and keep
the northern provinces in subjection. He had
previously got possession of Fort Conceiçam.
Each party seems at this time to have been
strangely ignorant of the movements and means
of the other: Loison apprehended that an enemy’s
force might render it impossible for the French
to maintain this fort; he therefore directed General
Charlot, whom he left with the command
at Almeida, to remove thither the guns from
Conceiçam, keep it as long as he could, and destroy
the works if he should be forced to evacuate

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

it. He then began his march with two regiments
of light infantry, fifty dragoons, and six pieces of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 148–150.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

artillery. A battalion of light infantry was to set
out from Torres Vedras, and reach Porto at the
same time.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he reached Lamego without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
the slightest resistance, and on the following
morning crossed the Douro by the ferry at Regoa,
and reached Mezam-frio, meaning to sleep there.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>He turns back from Mezam-frio.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

His advanced guard was on the way to Amarante,
which is only forty miles from Porto, when news
was brought him while he was at dinner that
the mountaineers were defending the pass at Os
Padroens da Teixeira; and presently a second
ill messenger arrived with intelligence that his
baggage was attacked at Regoa. These operations
had been ably planned by Silveira, and
were well executed. In so strong a country he
deemed it better to turn back than to proceed
at the risk of being surrounded by an armed
population. An ambuscade among the vineyards
at Santinho annoyed him greatly on his
way toward the Douro, and he himself was
slightly hurt. The Portugueze, when they were
dislodged, retreated to the heights; the French
took up a position for the night, and in the
morning sacked the villages of Pezo and Regoa,
where neither age, nor infirmity, nor sex, nor
childhood, were spared by them; for Loison was
one of those men after Buonaparte’s own heart,
who, being equally devoid of honour and humanity,
carried on war in the worst spirit of the
worst ages, plundering and massacring without
shame and without remorse. He now understood
that Porto, which he had expected to find
discontented indeed, but passive and in subjection,
had thrown off the yoke; that a Portugueze
officer, with whom he maintained a secret correspondence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
had been fain to abscond from that
city; that the disbanded soldiers had reassembled;
and that the insurgent peasantry, in such
numbers as to be truly formidable, were moving

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The peasantry harass his retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

against him from all parts of the two northern
provinces. The news of his retreat was presently
known throughout the whole country between
the Tua and the Cavado; expresses and telegraphs
could not have communicated it more
rapidly than it was spread by the voluntary
bearers of good tidings. One column came from
Villa Real, one from Amarante, a third from
Guimaraens; a motlier assemblage had never
taken the field; ... the commonest weapons were
pikes and long poles armed with reaping-hooks
at the end; and there were as many abbots,
monks, friars, and parochial clergy in command,
as officers. The three columns united at Regoa,
too late to impede or molest the French in their
passage of the river. The enemy halted for part
of the night at Lamego, and resumed their retreat
at two in the morning. The Portugueze
came up with them that day at Juvantes, and
harassed them during three days. The total
want of discipline, order, and authority, rendered
their great superiority of numbers unavailing;
and after they had reached Castro d’Airo, dispersing
as irregularly as they had collected, they
gave up the pursuit, less in consequence of the
loss which they sustained in a few brisk encounters,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 235–248. Thiebault, 150–1.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

than because they were too numerous
to find sustenance, and every man was eager to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
report the retreat of the enemy and the share he
had borne in the success. F. José Joaquim de
Assumpçam, a friar of orders gray, distinguished
himself in this expedition, by his activity, his
strength, and his unerring aim.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He goes to Viseu.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The loss on either side, in this pursuit, appears
not to have been great; the pursuers were too
disorderly and too ill armed to make any serious
impression upon the enemy, and the French
were not strong enough to act upon the offensive
with effect. They lost two pieces of artillery,
and some of their ammunition and baggage; and
a few rich uniforms which fell into the hands of
the Portugueze were suspended as trophies in
the churches of N. Senhora da Oliveira at Guimaraens,
and of S. Gonçalo de Amarante, in the
town which was under his peculiar patronage.
Being freed from his pursuers, Loison, sending
part of his force by the road of Moimenta da
Beira, which was the shorter but rougher line to
Almeida, took himself the way of Viseu. This

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alarm at Coimbra in consequence of his movements.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was the movement which alarmed the people at
Coimbra, and induced them to recall Zagalo from
Figueira. It was not improbable that his intention
was to march upon that important city,
and there place himself in communication with
Lisbon: his own judgement would dispose him

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 152.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to this, and indeed no fewer than five-and-twenty
dispatches, instructing him so to do, had been
sent, not one of which had reached him. But
he had received an exaggerated report of the
proceedings in Coimbra, brought by some partizans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
of the French, who had fled to save their
lives, on the night of the insurrection, when
their houses were broken open, during the suspension
of all order and authority. Their testimony
concerning the temper and unanimity of
the inhabitants could not be doubted; it was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 217.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

added, that they were busy in constructing formidable
works of defence, and that an auxiliary
force of 12,000 Spaniards was expected there.
Such strange events were now every day occurring,
that nothing seemed too extraordinary
to be believed; and Loison, it is thought, in
consequence of these rumours, judged it best

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>He returns to Almeida.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to change his purpose, and return to Almeida.
The Portugueze general who commanded in
Beira resided at Viseu; upon the approach of
the French he summoned the magistrates and
members of the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Camara</i>, and they determined
not to oppose a premature and unavailing resistance.
Loison, though notorious for rapacity, in
the most rapacious army that ever disgraced its
profession and its country, was at this time sensible
how desirable it was, if possible, to obtain
a character for moderation and equity. He encamped
his troops for the night without the city,
in the open space where the fairs were held,
took up his own lodging in the general’s house,
and on his departure the next day, paid for every
thing with which the men had been supplied.
He also released three or four prisoners, who, in
the late skirmishes, had fallen into his hands.
At Celorico, where an insurrectionary movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
had commenced, it was suspended by the prudence
of the magistrates and the just fears of
the people, till the enemy had passed by. The
peasantry of the adjacent country were less cautious;
they appeared in arms upon the heights,
and Loison therefore sent two companies to burn
the village of Souropires. Being now within
easy reach of Almeida, and knowing that the
country about Trancoso and Guarda was in a
state of insurrection, his intention was to employ

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 152.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

himself in reducing it to submission; but here
the only one of the numerous dispatches from
Lisbon which reached its destination found him,
and, in pursuance of its orders to draw nearer
the capital, he hastened to Almeida, to make the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 249–253.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

necessary arrangements for his march. On the
way he began to sack the city of Pinhel, which
the inhabitants had deserted at his coming; but
upon the tidings that a corps from Tras os Montes
had arrived at Trancoso, and that Viseu was now
in arms, he hastened forward, and on the 1st of
July re-entered Almeida.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Olham.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When Loison, upon the first apprehension of
danger, was sent to occupy Porto, General Avril
was instructed, at the same time, to take possession
of Estremoz and Evora, for the purpose
of holding Alem-Tejo in subjection, and to give
orders for securing Algarve. General Maurin
commanded for the French in this kingdom, as
it is designated, the smallest but richest province
in Portugal: owing to his illness the command
had devolved upon Col. Maransin, who received<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
instructions to occupy Mertola as well as Alcoutim,
for guarding the Guadiana against the
Spaniards; and to protect the coast from Faro,
the greatest port in that province, to Villa Real,
the frontier town, at the mouth of the river.
Maransin, however, was not left at leisure to
do this. Junot’s proclamation, announcing the
seizure of the Spanish troops, expressing his satisfaction
with the Portugueze for their peaceable
deportment, and promising to instruct them in
the art of war, had been fixed upon the church
door at Olham, a small fishing village about four
miles from the city of Faro. The governor of
Villa Real, Col. José Lopes de Sousa, happening
to be in that village on the day of the Corpo de
Deos, as he was going into the church stopped
to see what the people were reading. The language
of that proclamation proved how little
Junot understood the character of the nation to
which it was addressed; it wounded that high
sense of national honour for which the Portugueze
are remarkable, and Lopes, giving way to an
honourable feeling of indignation, tore the paper
down, and trampled upon it; then turning to
the bystanders, exclaimed, “Ah, Portugueze,
we no longer deserve that name ... we are nothing
now!” But they answered, that they were still
Portugueze, and swore that they were ready to
lay down their lives for their religion, their
Prince, and their country. Though the impulse
had thus been given, and the determination of
the parties formed, they did not neglect the religious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
duties of the day, but entered the church
peaceably, and attended mass. That done, they
proclaimed the Queen and Prince Regent in the
porch, and called upon Lopes to be their general.
He without delay prepared an address to the
people, and sent for two pieces of artillery and
some powder from an island at the bar of Armona,
and from Fort Lorenzo on the bar of Faro.
These were secured before the French in Faro
could hear of the projected insurrection. Two
agents also went off to the English squadron;
the means which were at the commandant’s disposal
had probably been all disposed of to the Spaniards;
they proceeded therefore to Ayamonte,
and performed their errand with such good speed,
that on the following night they returned to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 270–275.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Olham with 130 muskets from the Junta of that
city.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Success of the insurgents.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The greater part of Maransin’s force was stationed
at Mertola, the rest was at Tavira and
Villa Real, except 200 men at Faro. But before
the news reached Faro a larger body of fishermen
and peasantry had collected than 200 men
could with any prudence have attacked. The
French therefore sent for reinforcements from
Villa Real and Tavira. From the latter place
fourscore men embarked for Faro in three caics.
The fishermen of Olham, confident in their skill
upon the water, set out to intercept them under
Captain Sebastiam Martins Mestre, one of those
persons who had opened a communication with
the English fleet and with Ayamonte. So little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
were the French prepared for such an encounter,
that they surrendered without resistance, and
thus the insurgents obtained a seasonable supply
of arms. They were not long allowed to enjoy
their victory; about 200 French arrived from
Villa Real to assist their countrymen at Faro,
and they marched against Olham. The Portugueze
met them half way, and disposed an ambuscade
to receive them: their own eagerness
prevented its success; but they behaved so well
in a skirmish which ensued, that the enemy
thought it not prudent to advance. This was
the third day of the insurrection, and the people
of Faro had as yet made no manifestation in its

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Chamber of Faro issue an edict against them.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

favour. The chamber of that city had, on the
contrary, issued an edict against the insurgents,
for what it denominated a riotous and scandalous
attempt against the security of the nation, saying
that their conduct would brand the Portugueze
with the infamous stain of ingratitude, and warning
them against the severe punishment which
awaited them if they persisted in their frantic
and desperate attempt. This edict was posted
up in Olham; and it so evidently affected the
people, in whom great excitement and fatigue
had now produced proportionate exhaustion, that

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 275–281.
<br />
Observador Portuguez, 332, 333.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Lopes and Mestre, who had been hurt in the
skirmish, thought it prudent to carry their prisoners
to Spain, and go themselves to solicit aid
from the Juntas at Ayamonte and at Seville.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Faro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Maransin, not aware of their departure, and
anxious to lose no time in suppressing a spirit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
the consequences of which he had so much reason
to dread, sent out three pieces of cannon to
his detachment, and for want of French troops,
a party of fifty Portugueze artillerymen, under
Lieutenant Belchior Drago, an officer much more
inclined to act against the enemies of his country
than with them. Meantime the commander of
the French, having learnt that the people of
Olham were wavering, succeeded in obtaining a
conference with some of them, and proposed
terms. He promised them a free pardon, if they
would return to their obedience; said that they
should be protected in their fishery, and that
even Lopes himself should be no otherwise
punished than by forbidding him to appear in
that place. The persons to whom these conditions
were propounded listened to them willingly,
and expressed an opinion that the people
would probably assent, if the Portugueze authorities
in Faro gave their sanction to the proposals.
Some of the magistrates accordingly
went to conclude this agreement with the Prior
of Olham, a zealous Portugueze, to whom, in the
absence of Lopes and Mestre, the insurgents
looked as their proper counsellor and ruler. But
at this moment, when the French by mere authority
had nearly quelled the insurrection, the
spell was broken, and they were made sensible
that they had relied too confidently upon the
terror of their name. A few Faro-men met in
the shop of one Bento Alvares da Silva Canedo,
and determined, while the French troops were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
absent, to raise the city against them. They
hired a fellow for a few moidores to give the
signal, by chiming the bells of the Carmo church
at a certain hour, in the manner usual in that
country when prayers are solicited for a woman
in labour. They who had concerted the scheme
sallied into the streets, and proclaimed their native
Prince; the populace gathered together at
that welcome acclamation; a colonel of artillery
joined them, and sent advice to Belchior Drago,
who immediately returned to the city with his
detachment; two of his brothers, both in the
Portugueze service, appeared in the same cause,
and the rest of the native troops without hesitation

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French excluded from that city.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

did the same. The French, when they would
have re-entered the city to restore order, found
cannon planted against them by men who knew
how to use them; and, being repulsed in two
attempts, retreated towards Tavira. Their magazines,
their military chest, and all their papers,
were taken<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>, General Maurin, sick in bed, was
necessarily left to his fate; and the populace
would have killed him in their first use and abuse
of power, if some humaner spirits had not interfered
to preserve him. The Bishop also exerted

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 333–335.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

himself to prevent this inhumanity, and had him

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 282–289.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

transferred to the episcopal palace for security.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>A Junta formed at Faro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following morning an assembly of the
people was held in the Alto da Esperança. The
magistrates, the Bishop and his chapter, the clergy,
the monks and friars, (who had all taken arms),
the troops and the nobles, met and solemnly proclaimed
their lawful Prince; the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Quinas</i> were
hoisted, and an oath was taken that they would
each to the last drop of his blood defend the rights
of the house of Braganza. Circular letters were
dispatched to all the towns and villages in Algarve.
The next day some instances of insubordination,
and the reasonable apprehension of an attack,
induced one of the canons to propose, and the
people to consent, to the appointment of a Junta.
The Chamber nominated seven electors for the
nobles, and as many for the people, the chapter
seven for the clergy, and the army seven for themselves.
By these electors eight members were
chosen, two for each of the four orders, and the
Conde de Castro-Marim was appointed president.
This nobleman had been governor and captain-general
of Algarve at the time of the invasion;
under the intrusive government he resided as a
private individual at Tavira, and the popular desire
of re-establishing the order of things to which
they had been accustomed, was shown in nominating
him to the presidency, as it was indeed in
all the circumstances of the insurrection throughout

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The insurrection spreads through Algarve.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Portugal. Emissaries were now sent to the
east and west: in the west there were no enemies,
and within eight-and-forty hours the acclamation
was effected in Loule, Sylves, Lagos, at the fort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
of Sagres, and in the little towns to the north of
Cape St. Vincent. From the east there was
reason to apprehend an attack; the enemy, who
had been compelled to retire from Faro, had retreated
to Tavira, and had been joined there by
a detachment from Mertola. But the English
squadron was in sight; and the French commander,
knowing how inadequate his whole
force was to the dangers which menaced it,
knew also that Algarve might, with little inconvenience,
be left to itself, and that his business
was to place himself in communication with the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French retreat to Mertola.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

troops in Alem-Tejo. He therefore withdrew to
Mertola, and the people of Tavira, rising as soon
as the enemy retired, harassed them on the way.
Juntas, subordinate to that of Faro, were now
formed in Tavira, and in other smaller places; a
red riband upon the right arm was assumed as
the badge of patriotism, and they who ventured
to appear without it were in no small danger
from the people; but though many persons were
insulted and menaced, and some imprisoned as
partizans of the French, the better orders exerted
their influence with such effect, that no blood
was shed. Preparations were made for defending
the passes of the mountains which divide Algarve
from Alem-Tejo; and accredited agents
were sent to Ayamonte, Seville, and Gibraltar.
Arms were without delay supplied from all these
places, and from Gibraltar a considerable quantity
of ammunition. A circumstance, however, occurred,
which seemed likely at first to occasion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
a misunderstanding with the Spaniards; for the
Portugueze, upon the retreat of the French,
having thrown up some works at Castro-Marim,
the Spaniards crossed the river and destroyed
them. This measure, so rash, and in appearance
so hostile, was occasioned by an apprehension
that the French might return there, which they
had made a demonstration of doing before they

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The people of Algarve form a treaty with Seville.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

abandoned Tavira. It was soon explained, when
each people had so strong an interest in being
upon the best terms with each other, and a formal

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 290–303.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

treaty was concluded with the Junta of Seville.</p>

<p>Before the insurrection in Algarve had succeeded,
and even before it was known beyond
the mountains, the same national feeling had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Villa-Viçosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

manifested itself in Alem-Tejo at Villa-Viçosa,
the place of all others where the national and
loyal feelings of a Portugueze would be most
elevated by local associations, having been the
residence of the Braganzan family during the
Spanish usurpation. Early in the month the inhabitants
had been exasperated by the passage of
a French escort through the town, with the contributions
that had been levied in that <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Comarca</i>
and the plate of the churches. They were farther
irritated by an order for the militia to repair to
Elvas at a time when Kellermann hoped to employ
them against the Spaniards at Badajoz. But
Elvas, where the main body of the French in
Alem-Tejo were stationed, was only four leagues
distant; there was a strong detachment still
nearer, at Estremoz, and a French company<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
was quartered among them, in the castle: they
knew not that any movement for the recovery
of their country’s independence had been made;
nor, owing to their peculiar situation, were there
any people in Portugal by whom it could be made
with so little hope or possibility of success. Thus
they had borne oppression, and might have continued
to bear it, if their oppressors, in the
wantonness of power, had not added insult to
wrong. There was an image of N. Senhora dos
Remedios, which, after having by a supernatural
declaration of its own pleasure, changed its name,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Santuario Mariano, t. vii. 571, 579.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

made sundry voyages to and from India, and
travelled from one place to another in Portugal
during more than fourscore years, had at length
obtained a settlement at Villa-Viçosa, in a chapel
of its own, where, being in high odour for its
miraculous powers, it was visited with peculiar
devotion on its own holyday, the 19th of June,
by the people of that town, and the adjacent
country. The history of this idol might excite
a mournful smile for human weakness, not without
indignation at the systematic frauds which
have been practised upon a religious people.
The French were too irreligious to see any
thing in it but matter of mockery; and some of
the soldiers, placing themselves in a gateway
near the chapel, amused themselves with deriding
the Portugueze, who were going there to
worship, in ignorance indeed, and in delusion,
but in simplicity and sincerity of heart. Some
of the peasants resented this insult by manual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
force; more Frenchmen came to help their
comrades, more Portugueze to support their
countrymen; the scuffle became serious, for life
or death, ... the bell of the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Camara</i> was rung, the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 305–309.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

French retired into the Castle, and succeeded
in closing the gate, which had been so well secured
with iron in old times, that the people
were neither able to break it open, nor to hew
it in pieces. This was towards evening, and the
riot continued all night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French enter the town.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The town was now in open insurrection. Messengers
set off to solicit succour from Badajoz,
and General Francisco de Paula Leite, who had
lately governed the province, was called upon to
take the command, which he absolutely refused,
knowing that this tumult must inevitably end
in the destruction of those who engaged in it.
Antonio Lobo Infante de Lacerda, an old officer,
and then Sargento-Mor of the militia, regarding
consequences less, set his life fairly upon the die;
he took the lead, and stationed marksmen upon
the top of the Conceiçam church, and in other
points which commanded the Castle. Owing
to these dispositions several of the French fell.
Meantime the news reached Estremoz, where
Kellermann and Avril both happened to be:
fifty dragoons, with half a battalion of infantry,
and two pieces of cannon, were immediately dispatched
to rescue their fellows. A poor countryman,
by name Ignacio da Silva, was in Estremoz
at the time; seeing their movements, he easily
divined their intention; good will gave him good<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
speed, and running the ten miles, he brought
intelligence of their march to Villa-Viçosa in
time for Antonio Lobo to make preparations
for receiving them. He stationed some forty
men, all for whom fire-arms could be found,
upon the walls, and towers, and houses, at the
entrance from the Borba road; the enemy, informed
of, or divining this design, took another
entrance. The way was soon cleared by their
field-pieces. General Avril and Colonel Lacroix
entered the town in pursuit of the routed multitude,
the bayonet was used, with little mercy
or discrimination, 200 persons were killed in the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 335.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

streets, many more in the country, twelve prisoners

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 309–315.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were put to death as ringleaders in what
the French called rebellion, and the place was
given up to pillage for one hour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lobo gets possession of Jurumenha.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The messengers from this unfortunate town
had been joyfully received at Badajoz; and
Moretti, the officer who had performed the perilous
service of conferring with General Carraffa
in Lisbon, was dispatched with a corps of
Portugueze refugees which had been formed
under protection of the Spanish fortress. They
had arrived at Olivença on their way, when
Antonio Lobo arrived there also, escaping with
about a score companions from the carnage.
Instead of returning with ill news, as a man of
ordinary spirit would have done, Moretti inquired
whether some useful enterprise might
not be attempted; and they determined upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
getting possession of Jurumenha, knowing how
important it was that the Portugueze loyalists
should possess a place within their own border,
which had the name of being fortified, when the
French were in no condition to attack it. It
was occupied by a Portugueze garrison, but the
governor partook so little in the honourable feelings
of his nation, that he had that day seized
some fugitives from Villa-Viçosa, and sent them
prisoners to Elvas, requesting at the same time
a French garrison for his security and that of the
place. He understood the temper of his own
people; but Moretti and Lobo knew it also, and
calculated upon it. Sixteen Portugueze, concealing
their arms, entered as if upon ordinary
business; eight proceeded to seize the governor,
the others took their station in the gates, and
admitted their party just in time to point the
artillery of the place against the French, who
had been ordered from Elvas to occupy it without
delay. Moretti now obtained farther assistance
from Badajoz, and discretionary powers: on
the other hand, Kellermann sent a second party
to recover Jurumenha; but supposing the force
which defended it to be much stronger than in
reality it was, they returned without venturing
to attack it. This greatly encouraged the Portugueze,
and more than counterbalanced the effect
of their slaughter at Villa-Viçosa. Emissaries and
proclamations were sent from hence throughout

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 316–320.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the province; and the people, exaggerating the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
importance of the place, looked to it with confidence
as a strong point of support in their own
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>A French detachment sent from Mertola to Beja.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The news from Algarve, spreading at the same
time, elevated their spirits; and the state of the
country soon became such, that the French couriers
were every where intercepted. Colonel
Maransin, with his troops, had now effected his
retreat to Mertola, from whence, for the purpose
of restoring a communication with Estremoz and
with Lisbon, he sent a detachment of 100 foot
and thirty dragoons to Beja. That city was originally
a settlement of the Kelts, possessed next
by the Carthaginians, afterwards the Pax Julia
of the Romans, a Moorish corruption of which
name has been euphonized to its present form.
It was taken from the Moors by the first king of
Portugal, restored from its ruins and fortified in
the thirteenth century by Affonso III. and beautified
by his son, King Diniz, with his characteristic
magnificence, of which the walls with
their forty towers, and the fine castle, bore testimony
in their ruins. Here, as in all the other
cities of Alem-Tejo, there was a melancholy air
of decay, less owing to the long and destructive
struggle with Spain, in which that province had
been the great scene of action, than to the peculiar
circumstances which depressed its agriculture,
and that inhuman persecution of the
New-Christians, by which the largest part of the
commercial capital in Portugal had either been
annihilated by confiscations, or driven out of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
kingdom. Still, however, it contained some ten
or twelve thousand inhabitants, and was a place
of considerable importance in that thinly peopled
province. It stood on the highest part of an
elevated and extensive plain, conspicuous from
a distance, and commanding a wide prospect on
all sides, the heights of Palmella and even of
Cintra being distinctly visible. The immediate
country, where it is cultivated, is fertile, and
the situation in high repute for its salubrity.
Eventful as the history of Beja had been, it was
now to undergo as severe a calamity as any with
which it had been visited in the unhappiest ages
of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 23.</span>
<br /><hr />
The people rise against them.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French detachment entered the city without
opposition, passed the night there, and on the
next day ordered quarters and provisions to be
made ready for the whole body of troops in Mertola,
who, they said, were about to follow them.
Their demand was received in such a manner
by the people of Beja, who were now acquainted
not only with the state of Spain, but with the
nearer events in Algarve and at Jurumenha, that
the French deemed it prudent to march out, and
take a position in the open country, not far from
the walls. This encouraged the populace; and,
like all mobs, becoming cruel as they felt themselves
strong, they murdered two soldiers whom
the French indiscreetly sent into the city for provisions.
Ignorant of their fate, the commander
supposed they had been imprisoned, and threatened,
if they were not immediately set free, to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
release them by force. The people then riotously
demanded arms, that they might rush out
and attack the enemy. The magistrates remonstrated
with them in vain, and on the following

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

morning the Corregidor, finding that farther
delay would only endanger his own life, distributed
among them such weapons as could be
collected, and taking the safest course for himself,
set off to solicit aid from the Junta of Ayamonte,
the nearest authority by which it could
be supplied. The Provedor and the Juiz de Fora
thought it their duty to avert, if possible, the
immediate danger: they went out to the French,
entreated them not to attack the town, and promised
them supplies; the enemy were easily
entreated, because they were not strong enough
in reality for any such attempt: the magistrates
then endeavoured to make the people ratify what
they had undertaken for them; all reasoning was
in vain, and to save their own lives they left the
city. But here also private malice availed itself
of public troubles to effect its own ends; a messenger
recalled them, upon the plea that they
were wanted to give orders for collecting provisions,
in fulfilment of their agreement; for the
Corregidor having departed, there was no person
to take upon himself that business. Deceived

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 323–327.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

by this treacherous message, they returned, and
were butchered by a ferocious mob, who knew
not that they were made the brutal instruments
of individual revenge.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Beja sacked by the French, and set on fire.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By this time, however, the ardour of the people
had so far cooled, that they no longer talked of
sallying against the French, they contented themselves
with keeping a tumultuous watch through
the night; and when the morning dawned, and
there appeared no enemy, they fancied themselves
secure. The French commander had merely retired
out of sight: his dispatches reached Mertola
at eleven on the preceding night; at midnight
Maransin, with 950 men, began his march,
and at four the next evening the united force

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

arrived before Beja. They were opposed by a
mere multitude without order, leader, or plan
of defence, every man acting for himself as he
thought best. Yet the victory was not gained
without a brave resistance, and some loss to the
assailants. According to the French account
they lost eighty in killed and wounded, while
1200 of the Portugueze were slain in the action,
and all who were taken in arms were put to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 341.
<br />
Neves, iii. 327–332.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

death. The worst excesses followed by which
humanity can be disgraced and outraged, and
the<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> city was sacked and set on fire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
In this whole merciless proceeding Maransin
acted upon his own judgement, well knowing
that such was the system which Napoleon had
laid down, and which his generals felt no reluctance
in executing. He proceeded to Evora,
and Kellermann, approving of his conduct, held
out the fate of Beja in a proclamation, as a warning

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kellermann’s proclamation to the people of Alem-Tejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to the province. “Inhabitants of Alem-Tejo,”
he said, “Beja had revolted, and Beja
exists no longer. Its guilty inhabitants have
been put to the edge of the sword, and its houses
delivered up to pillage and to the flames. Thus
shall all those be treated who listen to the counsels
of a perfidious rebellion, and with a senseless
hatred take arms against us. Thus shall those
bands of smugglers and criminals be treated, who
have collected in Badajoz, and put arms into the
hands of the unhappy Lusitanians, but dare not
themselves march against us. Who, indeed, can
resist our invincible troops? Ye who have precipitated
yourselves into rebellion, prevent, by
prompt submission, the inevitable chastisement
that awaits you! And ye who have hitherto<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
been happy or prudent enough to continue in
your duty, profit by this terrible example! Our
general in chief has not told you in vain that

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 347.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

clouds of rebels shall be dispersed before us like
the sands of the desert before the impetuous
breath of the south wind.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junot’s proclamation to the Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The bombastic sentence which Kellermann
thus quoted, was from a proclamation that Junot
had just sent forth, in that spirit of shameless
falsehood and remorseless tyranny which characterised
the intrusive government. He asked the
Portugueze what madness possessed them? What
reason they could have, after seven months of the
most perfect tranquillity, of the best understanding,
to take arms; ... and against whom? against
an army which was to secure their independence
and maintain the integrity of their country! Was
it their wish, then, that ancient Lusitania should
become a province of Spain? Could they regret
a dynasty which had abandoned them, and under
which they were no longer counted among the
nations of Europe? What more could they desire
than to be Portugueze, and independent? and
this Napoleon had promised them. They had
asked him for a king, who, under his all-powerful
protection, might restore their country to its
rank. At this moment their new monarch was
expecting to approach them. “I hoped,” said
Junot, “to place him in a peaceable and flourishing
kingdom; am I to show him nothing but
ruins and graves? Will he reign in a desert?
assuredly not; and you will not be any thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
but a wretched province of Spain. Your customs
and laws have been maintained; your holy religion,
which is ours also, has not suffered the
least insult; it is you who violate it, suffering it
to be influenced by heretics, who only wish for
its destruction. Ask the unhappy Roman-catholics
of Ireland under what oppression they
are groaning! If these perfidious islanders invade
your territory, leave me to fight them; ...
your part is to remain peaceably in your fields.”
He then attempted to soothe them, saying, that
if any abuses in the administration still existed,
every day’s experience would diminish them.
The Emperor, satisfied with the reports which
he had received of the public spirit, had graciously
remitted half the contribution. He was
fulfilling all their wishes. And would they let
themselves be dragged on by the influence of a
banditti, at the very moment when they should
be happy? “Portugueze,” said he, “you have
but one moment to implore the clemency of the
Emperor and disarm his wrath. Already the
armies of Spain touch your frontiers at every
point; ... you are lost if you hesitate. Merit
your pardon by quick submission, or behold
the punishment that awaits you! Every village
or town in which the people have taken arms,
and fired upon my troops, shall be delivered up
to pillage, and destroyed, and the inhabitants
shall be put to the sword. Every individual

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 317–320.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

found in arms shall instantly be shot.”</p>

<p>The French had dealt largely in false promises;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
they were sincere in their threats, and on
the very day when this proclamation was issued
at Lisbon, that sincerity was proved at Beja.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>National feeling of the Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

But as the Portugueze had not been deceived,
neither were they now to be intimidated. Their
character had been totally mistaken by their insolent
oppressors. They, like the Spaniards, had
a deep and ever-present remembrance of their
former greatness. It was sometimes expressed
with a vanity which excited the contempt of those
who judge hastily upon that imperfect knowledge
which is worse than ignorance; more generally it
produced a feeling of dignified and melancholy
pride. The kingdom had decayed, but the degeneracy
of the people was confined to the higher
ranks, whom every possible cause, physical and
moral, combined to degrade. Generation after
generation, they had intermarried, not merely
within the narrow circle of a few privileged
families, but oftentimes in their own; uncles
with their nieces, nephews with their aunts.
The canonical law was dispensed with for these
alliances; but no dispensing power could set
aside the law of nature, which rendered degeneracy
the sure consequence. Thus was the
breed deteriorated; and education completed
the mischief. The young fidalgo was never regarded
as a boy: as soon as the robes, or rather
bandages of infancy were laid aside, he appeared
in the dress of manhood, was initiated in its forms
and follies, and it was rather his misfortune than
his fault, if, at an early age, he became familiar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
with its vices. When he arrived at manhood, no
field for exertion was open to him, even if he
were qualified or disposed to exert himself. The
private concerns of embellishing and improving
an estate were as little known in Portugal as
those public affairs in which the nobility of
Great Britain are so actively engaged: if not
in office, he was in idleness, and his idleness was
passed in the capital. A wasteful expenditure
made him a bad landlord, and a bad paymaster;
a deficient education made him a bad statesman;
and well was it if the lax morality which the
casuists had introduced into a corrupt religion,
did not make him a bad man. Exceptions there
were, because there are some dispositions so
happily tempered, that their original goodness
can never be wholly depraved, however unpropitious
the circumstances in which they are
placed; but men, for the most part, are what
circumstances make them, and these causes of degeneracy
were common to all of the higher class.
On the other hand, the middle classes were improved,
and the peasantry uncorrupted. Their
occupations were the same as those of their forefathers;
nor did they differ from them in any
respect, except what was a most important one
at this time, that a long interval of peace, and
their frequent intercourse with the Spaniards,
had effaced the old enmity between the two
nations, so that along the border the languages
were intermingled, and intermarriages so common,
as to have produced a natural and moral<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
union. They were a fine, hospitable, noble-minded
race, respected most by those who knew
them best. The upper boughs were scathed,
but the trunk and the root were sound.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their hatred of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Their ignorance as well as their superstition,
contributed at this time to excite and sustain a
national resistance. They expected miracles in
their favour; the people of Coimbra actually
believed that a miracle had been wrought, because
when the French fired upon them from
the windows of their quarters, no person was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 210.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

hurt. Of the relative strength of nations they
knew nothing, nor of the arrangements which
are necessary for carrying on war, nor of the resources
by which it must be maintained. Spain
filled a larger space in their imagination than
France, and Portugal than either; and they were
not erroneous in believing that Spain and Portugal
together possessed a strength which might
defy the world. The threats of the intrusive
government therefore excited indignation instead
of dismay; such language addressed to
minds in their state of exaltation, was like
water cast upon a fire intense enough to decompose
it, and convert its elements into fuel
for the flames. The fate of Beja excited hatred
and the thirst of vengeance instead of fear, and
the insurrection continued to spread in the very
province where the experiment had been made
upon so large a scale of putting an end to it by
fire and sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Juiz de Fora at Marvam.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A Portugueze of the old stamp, by name Antonio<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
Leite de Araujo Ferreira Bravo, held the
office of Juiz de Fora at Marvam, a small town
about eight miles from Portalegre, surrounded
with old walls. Of the many weak places upon
that frontier it was the only one which, in the
short campaign of 1801, resisted the Spaniards
in their unjust and impolitic invasion, and was
not taken by them; and this was in great measure
owing to his exertions. When the French
usurped the government, a verbal order came
from the Marquez d’Alorna, at that time general
of the province, to admit either French or Spanish
troops as friends, and give them possession of
the place. Antonio Leite protested against this,
maintaining that no governor ought to deliver
up a place intrusted to his keeping without a
formal and authentic order: proceedings were
instituted against him for his opposition, and he
was severely reprehended, this being thought
punishment enough at that time, and in a town
where no commotion was dreamt of. When the
decree arrived at Marvam, by which it was announced
that the house of Braganza had ceased
to reign, Antonio Leite sent for the public notaries
of the town, and resigned his office, stating,
in a formal instrument, that he did this because
he would not be compelled to render that obedience
to a foreign power which was due to his
lawful and beloved Sovereign, and to him alone.
Then taking with him these witnesses to the
church of the Misericordia, he deposited his wand
of office in the hands of an image of N. Senhor dos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Passos, and in the highest feeling of old times
called upon the sacred image to keep it till it
should one day be restored to its rightful possessor.
He then returned to his house, and put
himself in deep mourning. The order arrived
for taking down the royal arms. He entreated
the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Vereador</i> not to execute it, upon the plea
that the escutcheon here was not that of the
Braganza family, but of the kingdom, put up in
the reign of Emanuel, and distinguished by his

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, ii. 109–122.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

device; and when this plea was rejected, he took
the shield into his own keeping, and laid it carefully
by, to be preserved for better days.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He flies the town.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Juiz seems to have been a man who
had read the chronicles of his own country till
he had thoroughly imbibed their spirit. These
actions were so little in accord with the feelings
and manners of the present age, that they were
in all likelihood ascribed to insanity, and that
imputation saved him from the persecution which
he would otherwise have incurred. But when
the national feeling began to manifest itself, such
madness was then considered dangerous, and the
Corregidor of Portalegre received orders from
Lisbon to arrest him. Before these orders arrived
he had begun to stir for the deliverance of his
country, and had sent a confidential person with
a letter to Galluzo, the Spanish commander at
Badajoz, requesting aid from thence to occupy
Marvam; men could not be spared; and the
messenger returned with the unwelcome intelligence
that before he left Badajoz the business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
on which he went had transpired, and was
publicly talked of. Perceiving now that his life
was in danger, his first care was that no person
might suffer but himself, and therefore he laid
upon his table a copy of the letter which he had
written, from which it might be seen that the
invitation was his single act and deed; having
done this, he seemed rather to trust to Providence
than to take any means for securing
himself. It was not long before, looking out at
the window, he saw the Corregedor with an
adjutant of Kellermann’s and a party of horse
coming to his house. He had just time to bid
the servant say he was not within, and slip into
the street by a garden door. He had got some
distance, when the Corregedor saw him, and
called after him, saying he wanted to settle with
him concerning the quartering of some troops.
Antonio Leite knew what his real business was
too well to be thus deceived, and quickened his
pace. The town has two gates, one of which
was fastened, because the garrison was small:
toward that however he ran, well knowing that
if he were not intercepted at the other, he
should be pursued and surely overtaken. Joaquim
José de Matos, a Coimbra student, then
at home for the vacation, met him, and offered
to conceal him in his house; but the Juiz continued
to run, seeing that the soldiers were in
pursuit, dropt from the wall, escaped with little
hurt, and then scrambled down the high and
steep crag upon which it stands. Matos, thinking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
that he had now involved himself, ran also,
and being of diminutive stature, squeezed himself
through a hole in the gate; they then fled
together toward Valencia de Alcantara, and had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 333–337.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the satisfaction, at safe distance, of seeing a Swiss
escort come round the walls to the place where
the Juiz had dropt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He returns, and seizes the town.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Spanish frontier being so near, their escape
was easy; but when they had been a few days at
Valencia de Alcantara, Matos determined upon
returning to his family, knowing that there was
no previous charge against him, and thinking
that the act of having spoken to the Juiz could
not be punished as a crime. In this he was mistaken.
The governor of Marvam was a worthy
instrument of the French. He not only arrested
Matos, but his father also, an old man who was
dragged from his bed, where he lay in a fit of
the gout, to be thrown into a Portugueze prison;
and a physician, whom he suspected of being
concerned in the scheme of an insurrection. This
news reached the Juiz; it was added, that his
own property had been sequestered, he himself
outlawed, and all persons forbidden to harbour
him, and that a French escort had arrived to
carry the three prisoners to Elvas. He could
not endure to think that he should be, however
innocently, the occasion of their death, and therefore
determined to attempt at least their deliverance
at any hazard. It was not difficult to find
companions at a time when all usual occupations
were at a stand, and every man eager to be in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
action against an odious enemy. With a few
Spanish volunteers he crossed the frontier, and
there raised the peasantry, who knew and respected
him: with this force he proceeded to a
point upon the road between Marvam and Elvas;
the escort had passed, ... but he had the satisfaction
to learn that it had not gone for the prisoners,
only to bring away the ammunition and
spike the guns. This raised their spirits; they
directed their course to Marvam, climbed the
walls during the night, opened the prison, seized
the governor, and without the slightest opposition
from two hundred Portugueze troops,
whom he had just obtained from Elvas to secure
the place, and who, if they knew what was passing,
did not choose to notice it, the adventurers
returned to Valencia in triumph with their friends,
and with the governor prisoner. The Junta of
Valencia did not now hesitate, in conformity to
an order from Badajoz, to give the Juiz regular

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

assistance; he entered Marvam in triumph with
this auxiliary force, and the Prince Regent was
proclaimed there by the rejoicing inhabitants, at
the very time when Beja was in flames. A few

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Campo-Mayor.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

days afterwards a Spanish detachment from Albuquerque
entered Campo-Mayor with the same

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

facility. Some jealousies which arose there, as
well as at Marvam, from the inconsiderate conduct
of the Spanish officers in issuing orders as
if they were in their own territories, were put
an end to by the formation of a Junta, of which
the Spanish commander at Campo-Mayor was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
made president. The example of these places
was immediately followed at Ouguela, Castello
de Vide, Arronches, and Portalegre; and the
insurrection thus extended throughout all that

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iii. 337–360.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

part of the province which is to the north of
Elvas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Junot meantime was in a state of great anxiety
at Lisbon. It was not known what was become
of Maransin and the troops in Algarve; there
was no news of Loison; the insurrection in the
north had reached Coimbra, and was spreading
in Estremadura, and there was a report, probable
enough to obtain credit, that an expedition of
10,000 English was off the bar. He called a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

council, at which the generals of division, Comte
de Laborde and Travot, were present, the chief
of the staff, General Thiebault, Baron de Margaron,
and other officers. The result of their
conference was, that the army should be collected
in and near Lisbon, leaving garrisons in only the
three important places of Almeida, Elvas, and
Peniche; that Setubal and the left bank of the
Tagus should be maintained as long as possible;
that when the English appeared they should
occupy in succession three positions; one from
Leiria to Ourem and Thomar; a second from

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, Relation, 128.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Santarem to Rio-Mayor, Obidos, and Peniche;
lastly, one from Saccavem to Cintra: finally, that
they should defend Lisbon till the utmost extremity,
and only leave it to retire upon Elvas,
rest the troops there, and then force their way
either to Madrid, Segovia, or Valladolid. In</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />July.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

pursuance of this resolution, Kellermann was
summoned from Alem-Tejo, and courier after
courier dispatched to recall Loison from Beira.
Junot’s next measure was to put the church plate

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 321.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which he had secured in a portable form, and for
this purpose what there was no time for coining
was melted into ingots. To counteract the
rumours, true and false, by which the Portugueze
were encouraged, it was affirmed that Napoleon
had entered Spain, and that 20,000 men had
reached the frontiers of Portugal to reinforce the
French. Alarmed and harassed by contradictory
rumours, and dreading from the temper of the
people an insurrection, which would be punished
by a massacre, many families removed from Lisbon;
those who had country estates to their
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Quintas</i>, the greater number to the different

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 343. n.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

places on the opposite side of the river, particularly

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Almada and Casilhas. They were however
ordered to return; every head of a family
who did not within four days obey this order was
to be arrested, and all persons were prohibited
from leaving Lisbon, unless they were provided
with a passport from the police, ... an institution
to which the Portugueze at this time applied the
name of the Inquisition. It was of importance,
the decree said, that good citizens should be
secured against the ridiculous rumours which
were promulgated, and that all notions of danger
to the city of Lisbon should be put an end to;
the French army would know how to maintain
tranquillity there. This, however, was less a measure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
of policy than of extortion; those families
who had retired were made to pay, in proportion
to their means, for permission to remain
where they were. They who had nothing to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 345.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

give suffered the whole inconvenience of this
oppressive law.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They endeavour to avail themselves of the clergy’s influence.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French commander tried to suppress the
national feeling by the influence of religion. In
the village of Varatojo, near Torres Vedras, there
was a famous seminary for itinerant preachers of
the Franciscan order, instituted by Fr. Antonio
das Chagas, a man remarkable alike for his genius,
for the profligacy of his youth, and the active,
austere, enthusiastic piety of his after life. Junot
sent for the Guardian of this seminary, requiring
his immediate attendance; the old man, in strict
adherence to the rule of his order, which forbade
him to travel by any other means, obeyed the
summons on foot, and arrived four-and-twenty
hours later than the time appointed. He was
then ordered to dispatch some of his preachers,
as men who possessed great authority over the
people, to Leiria and into Alem-Tejo, to preach
the duty of submission and tranquil obedience.
The Guardian excused himself by representing
that his brethren who were qualified for such a
mission were already on their circuits, and that
there were then in the seminary none but youths
engaged in preparing for the ministry, and old
men, who, being past all service, rested there

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 61–63.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

from their labours, in expectation of their release.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The dignitaries of the patriarchal church could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
not so well evade his commands; a pastoral
letter was obtained from them denouncing excommunication
against all persons who should,
directly or indirectly, either by writing, speaking,
or acting, encourage the spirit of insurrection
which had gone abroad. This was sent into
the provinces, with a letter from the French intendant
of police, Lagarde, in which the clergy

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and the heads of convents were informed, that
wherever public tranquillity might be disturbed,
they would be held responsible, because no disturbance
would break out if they exerted themselves
to prevent it, as the true spirit of religion
required. The fate of Beja, he said, should be
that of every city in Portugal which should have
the guilty imprudence to revolt against the Emperor,
now the sole sovereign of that country.
And he asked the Portugueze, wherefore they
would bring upon themselves the heavy weight
of power at a moment when the Almighty authority
(such was the blasphemous expression)
thought only of putting in oblivion the rights of
conquest, and of governing with mildness? Is
it, said he, before a few handfuls of factious men

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 348–353.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in Portugal that the star of the great Napoleon
is to be obscured, or the arm of one of his most
valiant and skilful captains to be deadened?
Deeply as the baneful superstition of the Romish
church has rooted itself in that country, the
threat of excommunication excited nothing but
contempt. The French could not derive any
assistance from ecclesiastical interference while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
it was remembered that they had robbed the
churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Thomar.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It is not extraordinary that the intrusive government
should have failed to deceive the
people by its addresses; but that it should have
attempted so to do; that it should have talked
of benefits intended and conferred upon a nation
on whom it had brought such wide and general
misery, and inflicted injuries as unprovoked as
they were enormous, indicated indeed an effrontery
of which none but the agents of Buonaparte
were capable. Their insolent language exasperated
the Portugueze. One of these papers
was lying upon a tradesman’s counter in Thomar,
and one of their very few partizans vindicated
the manner in which the Prince was there spoken
of, saying, that the country was now rid of him
and of the Inquisition. A Franciscan who was
present immediately took a knife from his sleeve,
and struck it through the paper into the board,
saying, that in that manner he would serve any
one who dared speak against his Prince and his
religion: and producing a pistol, he was only
withheld by force from giving murderous proof
of his sincerity. An information was laid against
him, and a party of Portugueze soldiers sent from
Abrantes to arrest him: he absconded in time,
and the Guardian of the convent, who was suspected
of favouring his escape, was taken in his
stead. Before they could carry him out of the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 3–8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

town, the people rose and rescued him, and the
restoration of the legitimate government was proclaimed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
with the same ceremonies as in other
places.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insurrection at Leiria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>About the same time a handful of students
from Coimbra, collecting volunteers as they went,
spread the insurrection at Condeixa, Ega, and
Pombal, and approached Leiria, from which city
a small party of the French retired before them.
This place was within easy reach of the enemy,
and troops, arms, and ammunition were wanting
to defend it. The people sent to Coimbra for
all, as if Coimbra could supply either: the Bishop
exerted himself to forward the preparations; and
the people mustered tumultuously with that confidence
which an ignorant multitude always feels
of its own untried strength. The French had
some small garrisons upon the coast, about twenty
miles off, in the little forts of Nazareth, S. Giam,
and S. Martinho, which communicated with each
other by telegraphs, and drew rations every day
from the adjoining country. The Juiz of Pederneira
was compelled to furnish these; in this
time of alarm he was called upon to store them
with a convenient stock beforehand, and because
this was not, and could not be done in a few
hours, they began to pillage the neighbourhood.
Provoked at this, the fishermen fell upon a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Success of the insurgents at Nazareth.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Frenchman, who was going with dispatches from
S. Martinho to Nazareth, and murdered him,
crying, Down with the French! The sentinel
at the signal-post had the same fate ... the signal-post
was broken, and the country round about
was presently in insurrection. The enemy withdrew<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
from S. Giam and S. Martinho, having
hastily spiked two guns at the former place, and
buried two barrels of powder. They fell back
upon a detachment under General Thomieres,
which watched the country between the Caldas,
Obidos, and Peniche. Nazareth was blockaded
by the insurgents; the report was, that a considerable
Spanish army had arrived at Leiria,
and incredible as this was, it was believed, and
gave full confidence to these ignorant and zealous
people. They sent thither for assistance,
and the Coimbra students came with a party of
peasants, those who could muster the best arms.
The cannon were brought from S. Giam, and
rendered serviceable; the two barrels of powder
were discovered; a Portugueze artilleryman
escaped from the fort to join his countrymen,
and direct their operations; and the French,
finding themselves now in serious danger, capitulated

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to save their lives. The victorious students
and their party were far advanced on their

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 14–30.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

return to Leiria, when they heard news of that
miserable city, which rendered it necessary for
them to strike into the pine forest, and conduct
their prisoners by unfrequented ways to Figueira.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Margaron approaches Leiria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>General Margaron had been sent from Lisbon
with between 4000 and 5000 men, to check the
progress of the insurrection in Estremadura, and
learn some intelligence of Loison, from whom
nothing had been heard for a considerable time.
Though the disposition of the people was every
where the same, they were kept down by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
presence or by the neighbourhood of the enemy,
every where within reach of the capital; and he
met with no opposition till he approached Leiria.
That city, which is the most considerable place
on the road to Coimbra, is built upon the little
rivers Liz and Lena, in a beautiful country, an
hundred miles from Lisbon. It is believed to
have been built from the ruins of Colippo, a
Lusitanian city which the Romans destroyed;
and it has been asserted, that Sertorius planted a
colony there whom he brought from Liria in
Spain. Affonso Henriquez fortified it as a strong
hold against the Moors, who then possessed Santarem,
and recovered it after they had captured
it. Some of his successors occasionally resided
there, and its fine castle was enlarged and beautified
by Queen St. Isabel, wife of the magnificent
King Diniz. At the beginning of the last
century it contained 900 houses and 2150 communicants.
Its population had increased, and
might at this time have been estimated at about
5000. The adjacent country has been made the
scene of pastoral romance by Francisco Rodriguez
Lobo, for which it is precisely adapted by
its wild yet beautiful and peaceful character.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparation for defence.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The people of Leiria and the peasantry who
had collected there had had little time for preparation
when they heard that the French were
approaching. They had paraded through their
streets the banner of the city, bearing for its
device a crow upon a pine tree; in memory of
one which, when Affonso Henriquez attacked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
the city, perched there in the midst of his camp,
and clapped its wings and croaked in a manner
that was accepted as a good omen. They had
proclaimed the Prince, restored and repainted
the royal arms, and assisted at the performance
of <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">Te Deum</i> in the cathedral; but school-boys
in a rebellion could not have been more unprepared
with any plan of defence, or unprovided
with means for it. They were in an open city.
They had not a single piece of cannon. Of some
800 men who were stationed at outposts and
other points of danger, scarcely a fourth part
were armed with muskets, and for these three or
four round of cartridges were all that could be
found. To persons unacquainted with the character
and condition of the Portugueze it might
appear almost incredible that resistance should
have been attempted under circumstances thus
absolutely hopeless. But the people were goaded
by insult, and stung by the feeling of insupportable
wrong. They had been wantonly invaded, ...
grievously, inhumanly, and remorselessly oppressed.
They knew that the nation was rising
against its oppressors: they felt instinctively
what the strength of a nation is; and were too

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 31–36.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

much exasperated to consider, or too little informed
to understand, that without order and
discipline numbers are of little avail, and even
courage not to be relied on.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French enter the city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The higher orders were perfectly sensible of
their imminent danger, but they would have exposed
themselves to certain destruction if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
had attempted to reason with the infuriated multitude.
The magistrates therefore, and the person
who had been appointed to the command, withdrew
secretly from the city during the night, and
fled. In the morning five Frenchmen, who had
been surprised upon a marauding party, were

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

brought in prisoners. A short-lived and senseless
exultation was excited at their appearance.
At noon it was known that the enemy were close
at hand; they sent forward a peasant who had
fallen into their hands, and whom, contrary to
their custom, they had spared, to offer pardon to
the people if they would return to their obedience;
that offer being refused, they attacked
the insurgents. By their own account the resistance
was so momentary, that there was no time
for the artillery, nor for half the troops to take
part in the action. The insurgents threw away
their arms, like terrified villagers, imploring the
clemency of an irritated conqueror. From 800
to 900 were left upon the field. The city was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>3d Bulletin. Observador Portuguez, 357.
<br />
Thiebault, 143.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

entered on all sides. But, by their own account,
the moment the action was over, General Margaron
restrained the indignation of his troops;
their moderation was equal to their valour, and
victory was immediately followed by order. Margaron,
in a proclamation to the inhabitants, dwelt
upon his clemency. “A decree had been issued,”
he said, “commanding that every town where
the French were fired upon should be burnt, and
its inhabitants put to the sword.” They had incurred
that penalty, and his duty required him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
to inflict it. Nevertheless he had prevented the
massacre and the conflagration; not a house,
not a cottage had been burnt; he had protected
their persons and their property, as far as was
possible under such circumstances; and instead
of seeking for the guilty, he repeated to them
his offers of peace and union. He called upon
them to learn who were their real friends, and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, Pièces Justificatives, No. 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

lay aside their arms. “Leave,” said he, “the
noble task of protecting and defending you to
the soldiers of the great nation. Submit yourselves
to the power which Heaven supports,
and obey our holy church as I do, ... you in
renouncing your projects of exterminating the
French, I in forgiving all that you have done
against them.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Massacre of the prisoners.
<br /><hr />
Neves, iv. 48.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This is what the French relate of their conduct
at Leiria. “Sepulchres of Leiria,” exclaims the
Portugueze historian of these events, “prove ye
the falsehood with which these robbers, as cruel
as they are perfidious, have deceived the world!”
What they have not related is now to be recorded.
It is not dissembled by the Portugueze that the
defence was as feeble and as momentary as the
enemy describe it. They entered the city on all
sides, and began an indiscriminate butchery; old
and young, women and babes, were butchered,
in the streets, in the houses, in the churches, in
the fields. The most atrocious acts of cruelty
were committed, and not by the common soldiers
only. One of the superior officers related of himself,
that a feeling of pity came over him when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
upon entering the town he met a woman with
an infant at her breast, but calling to mind that
he was a soldier, he pierced mother and child
with one thrust! Free scope was given to every

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Memoir of the early Campaigns of the Duke of Wellington, p. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

abominable passion; and in the general pillage
the very graves were opened, upon the supposition
that treasure might have been hidden
there, as in a place where no plunderer would
look to find it. When the slaughter in the streets
had ceased, they began to hunt for prisoners, and
all who were found were taken to an open space
before the Chapel of S. Bartholomew, there to
be put to death like the prisoners at Jaffa. The
greater number of these poor wretches fell on
their knees, some stretching their hands in unavailing
agony toward their murderers for mercy;
others, lifting them to heaven, directed their last
prayers where mercy would be found. The murderers,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 37–42.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

as if they delighted in the act of butchery,
began their work with the sword and bayonet
and the but-end of the musket, and finished it
by firing upon their<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>victims.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison’s march from Almeida to Abrantes.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the same day actions of the same devilish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
character were committed by Loison’s division
on their way from Almeida. Leaving a garrison
of 1250 men in that place, and having blown up
the works of Fort Conception, he set out towards
Lisbon, in pursuance to the orders which he had
received, with between 3000 and 4000 troops.
The next day he approached the city of Guarda;
it happened to be Sunday, and also the annual
festival of Queen St. Isabel, whose name, stripped
of all fable and idolatrous observances, deserves
always to be held in dear and respectful remembrance
by the Portugueze. The assemblage of
people was therefore much greater than at other
times; but they were assembled to keep holyday,
not to provide for their defence. A Junta
had been constituted there two days before; and
with that miscalculation of strength, or ignorance
of the state of things, which prevailed so generally
among their countrymen, they seem not to
have considered themselves as in danger of an
attack till Loison was within two miles of the
city. An old iron gun, rusty and dismantled,
and lying useless in the ruins of the castle, was
their whole artillery; ... a few peasants mounted
it upon a cart, and so carried it to a rising ground
near the road, as if the sight of it would deter
the French from advancing. According to the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bulletin 4.<br />Observador Portuguez, 366.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

French official account, the rebels, as they insolently
styled the Portugueze, drew up in two

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 153.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

lines, having their flanks well supported, and
two pieces of cannon to protect their centre;
their lines were forced at all points, their guns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
taken, themselves surrounded as well as routed;
the disorder was general, the slaughter dreadful;
more than a thousand dead were left upon the
field, and Loison in pursuit of the fugitives
entered the city. The truth is, that a disorderly
multitude fled as soon as they were attacked;
and that, as all who could not escape were cut
down, the number of the slain has not perhaps
been much exaggerated. A night of licentiousness
and pillage followed, and Loison then proceeded.
The ancient and flourishing town of
Covilham escaped a similar visitation, because
it lay somewhat out of the line of his march,
and he had no time to spare. Alpedrinha, a
place containing between two and three thousand
inhabitants, was not so fortunate. On the
same day that Margaron entered Leiria, and with
as little resistance, General Charlot entered this

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 5.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

unhappy town; that General was one of the few
commanders who had hitherto obtained a character
for honour and humanity, ... here, however,
all horrible crimes and cruelties were committed;
one inoffensive old man was taken out
of the town, and burnt alive within sight and
hearing of the fugitives upon the mountains;
and the French, having carried off every thing

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 77.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that was portable, set the place on fire. They
proceeded, plundering as they went, by Sarzedas,
Cortiçada, and Sardoal to Abrantes.</p>

<p>The French stated in their bulletin that they
had lost upon their march twenty killed, and
from thirty to forty wounded, whereas the rebels<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
had left at least three thousand upon the different
fields of battle<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>. The character of the
intrusive government would be imperfectly understood
hereafter, if its language as well as its
acts were not faithfully recorded. The bulletin
which announced this statement to the Portugueze,
and to that great portion of the civilized
world in which the events of the war were
anxiously observed, proceeded to say, “this is
the mournful result of a frenzy which nothing
can justify, which nothing can excuse, and which
obliges us to multiply the number of victims who
excite sorrow and compassion, but upon whom
a terrible necessity compels us to inflict the
strokes of just vengeance. Thus it is that the
Portugueze people, blind instruments of the unfeeling
calculations of the British cabinet, destroy
with their own hands the happiness which
we with all our power were endeavouring to make
them enjoy! Thus it is that from the bosom of
tranquillity, of good order, and of repose, they
draw upon themselves the destructive scourge
of war, and bring devastation even upon the
very fields where God had given abundance!
Thus it is that deluded men, ungrateful children
as well as guilty citizens, change all the claims
which they had to the benevolence and protection
of government, for deserved misfortune
and wretchedness, ruin their families, carry desolation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
flames, and death, into their dwellings,
transform flourishing cities into heaps of ashes
and vast tombs, and by their fatal union draw
upon the whole country the calamities which
they provoke, which they deserve, and from
which (weak victims as they are) they cannot
escape, covering themselves with shame, and
completing her destruction. Thus it is that
no other resource remains to them than the
clemency of those whom they sought to assassinate,
... a clemency which they do not implore
in vain, when, acknowledging their crime,
they ask pardon from the French, who, incapable
of belying their noble character, are

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bulletin 4.<br />Observador Portuguez, 368.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

always as full of generosity as of valour.” This
was the<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>language of Buonaparte’s governor in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
Portugal! “To be the victim,” says Mr. Wordsworth,
commenting upon these things and words
at the time, in that strain of profoundest feeling
and philosophy by which his higher compositions
are so eminently distinguished, “to be the victim
of such bloody-mindedness, is a doleful lot for a
nation; and the anguish must have been rendered
still more poignant by the scoffs and insults,
and by that heinous contempt of the most
awful truths, with which the perpetrator of those
cruelties has proclaimed them. Merciless ferocity
is an evil familiar to our thoughts; but these combinations
of malevolence historians have not yet
been called upon to record; and writers of fiction,
if they have ever ventured to create passions resembling
them, have confined, out of reverence
for the acknowledged constitution of human nature,
those passions to reprobate spirits. Such
tyranny is, in the strictest sense, intolerable; not
because it aims at the extinction of life, but of
every thing which gives life its value, ... of virtue,
of reason, of repose in God, or in truth.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison ordered towards Coimbra.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Loison, for the sake of intimidating the country,
and thereby preventing the danger of such resistance
as he had experienced in Tras os Montes,
had sent before him a report that he had been
reinforced by 16,000 men from the army of
Marshal Bessieres; and this news was officially
transmitted to Junot by the Corregedor of
Abrantes. At first the French received the
tidings with entire belief, and with a joy proportionate
to the danger from which they now
thought themselves delivered. A comparison of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
dates and distances occasioned some uncomfortable
doubts, and the next day advices came that
Loison had arrived at Abrantes with no other
force than his own. But even this was of no
inconsiderable importance: it relieved them from
their anxiety concerning him, it brought the
whole of their disposable force within reach and
within command, for Kellermann had now arrived
with the troops from Alem-Tejo; and Junot determined
upon striking a great blow before the
English should appear. Kellermann had been
sent to Alcobaça, where the troops under General
Thomières, who covered Peniche, and those of
Margaron (who had received the submission of
the people of Thomar, and exacted from them

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 64.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

20,000 cruzados) were to be under his orders.
Loison was now instructed to form a junction
with them and take the command; crush the
insurgents in that part of the country, march
against Coimbra, subdue and chastise that city,
thus quenching one great furnace of the insurrection,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 146.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and return to Lisbon. Before he reached
Alcobaça part of these instructions had been fulfilled
by Thomières.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Nazareth sacked and burnt by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That General had advanced with a few hundred
men to Obidos, with the intention of relieving
the fort at Nazareth; but a reconnoitring party
which he sent forward to Barquinha was driven
back, four of his scouts were made prisoners and
sent on board an English vessel, and a report
that a considerable body of English had landed
there to assist the insurgents deterred him from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
proceeding in time. The Portugueze themselves
raised this report; in reality they had applied
for aid to the English, who, some time before,
had taken possession of the Berlengs; a few
pieces of cannon were given them, but the garrison
was so scanty that no men could be spared;
and the short respite which they obtained by
deceiving the enemy would have been better
employed in providing for escape, than for a
feeble and disorderly resistance. Nine days after
their triumph Thomières proceeded against them

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 14.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with 3000 men, in the belief that some English
had joined them. One column, under cover of
the darkness, got under the ill-served guns of
the insurgents before they were perceived; the
Portugueze fired in haste without aim and without
effect, and then took to flight. A few drunken
fellows, who had undertaken to serve the guns,
remained by them, with a woman and a few old
men, and these were put to death. The town of
Nazareth was sacked, and set on fire. The jewels
which they took from the church of N. Senhora de
Nazareth were estimated at more than £20,000;
for of the innumerable and many-named idols of
Our Lady in Portugal, this was the most celebrated.
It is the very image which, according
to the legend, St. Jerome sent from Bethlehem
to St. Augustine, and St. Augustine to his monks
at the Caulian monastery, from whence, at the
destruction of the Goths, it was brought by King
Roderick and Romano to this spot. It is said,
that during the last century the idol has sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
been visited by not less than 20,000 devotees
on the day of its festival. The enemy
then descending to the beach, burnt the lower
town, consisting of some 300 houses, of which
only four escaped the flames; they burnt also
the nets and vessels, upon which the inhabitants,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 84–87.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

being fishermen, depended for their subsistence:
they then plundered Pederneira, and set it on
fire, and returned with their booty to Alcobaça<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>A Junta established at Beja.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Loison having taken the command, proceeded,
in pursuance of his instructions, towards Coimbra;
but he had hardly got beyond Leiria when he
was recalled, in consequence of an alteration in
Junot’s plans, which the events in Alem-Tejo
had rendered necessary. In the north of that
province the insurrection was spreading far and
wide, while Beja was in flames; and when Kellermann
marched for Lisbon, leaving only a garrison
in Elvas, it spread with equal rapidity in the
south. Beja had not been destroyed by the fire;
houses with little furniture and little wood-work
are not easily burnt. The Corregedor returned
there from Ayamonte with a supply of arms; a
Junta was formed, which assumed great authority,
and acted with unusual promptitude and vigour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
Men were raised, the regular taxes claimed in
the name of the rightful government, and a detachment
under Sebastiam Martins Mestre, who
had taken an active part in Algarve, was sent to
guard against the French at Setubal, by forming
a cordon to guard the river Sadam. Having
raised a few men for this purpose in the districts
of Grandolo and Santiago de Cacem, he proceeded
to Alcacer do Sal, established a Junta there, and
brought four iron guns from Melides for the defence
of this town, a point of great importance
to the province while there was an enemy’s force

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 92–95.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

at Setubal: Setubal and Palmella were the only
places which they now occupied on that side the
Tagus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junta of Estremoz.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lobo meantime, leaving Moretti in Jurumenha,
formed Juntas at Borba and at Villa-Viçosa,
where he placed the palace and park upon their
former establishment. These Juntas readily acknowledged
the supremacy of Estremoz, where
one was at this time formed, which endeavoured
to make its authority recognized as supreme in
Alem-Tejo, and was supported in its pretensions
by the Spanish government at Badajoz. The
claim was admitted by all the smaller places in
the surrounding country, but not at Beja nor at
Campo-Mayor, in which latter place considerable
activity had been displayed. Instead of doubling
the soldiers’ pay, which had been rashly done
at Porto, the officers who assembled at Campo-Mayor
resolved that those whose means rendered
it possible should serve for half-pay, or without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
pay; they raised loans and donatives, levied a
third of the rent upon the entailed estates, and
took from the property of the church contributions
in kind; and having thus acquired considerable
funds, they undertook, and for a time
sustained, the improvident expense of paying
their Spanish allies. The ready obedience shown
to its authority, when these imposts were demanded,
and the power which it derived from
the distribution of the money thus raised, gave
the Junta of Campo-Mayor exaggerated notions
of its own importance, and when tidings arrived
that a Junta of higher or equal pretensions had
been formed at Estremoz, that of Campo-Mayor
sent to propose a reciprocal alliance, as if one
sovereign power were treating with another. But
in reply a paper in the form of a decree was sent,
declaring, that the primacy of the Junta of Estremoz
should be acknowledged by all others in
the province, because of the position of that
place, and because it was a fortified town; that
the members of that Junta should have the title
of Highness, because they represented the august
person of the Sovereign; and that there should
be a subordinate Junta in every town, and one
deputy from each sent as a representative to assist
in the Supreme Junta of Estremoz. Obedience

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 92–116.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to this decree was required from Campo-Mayor,
till a Supreme Junta should be established, as it
was about to be, at Evora, whither head-quarters
were to be removed.</p>

<p>The transfer of the supreme provincial authority<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
to Evora was concerted by Moretti and
by the Portugueze General Francisco de Paula
Leite, who had refused to concur in the first
hasty tumult at Villa-Viçosa, but who now, when
the insurrection had become general throughout
the province, felt himself bound to resume the
charge with which the Prince Regent had intrusted

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>A Supreme Junta formed at Evora.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

him. The object of this transfer seems
to have been a persuasion, that as Evora was the
most populous city in the province, and the seat
of the Archbishop, its authority would at once
be acknowledged, and all disputes for precedency,
which might otherwise prove so prejudicial to
the common cause, would thus be terminated.
This object was effected: in other respects the
measure was incautious, and contrary to the
judgement of the most judicious inhabitants; for
when Moretti had by letter proposed it to them,
they replied, that the richest city of Alem-Tejo,
lying as it did so near Elvas, ought not to declare
itself, unless it could reckon upon a force of 8000
men for its defence. It was not that the will was
wanting; this General Leite knew; and without
farther demur, he and Moretti and Lobo, with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

200 foot soldiers and 100 cavalry, entered Evora.
They were received with enthusiasm; a Junta
was formed under two presidents, Leite being
one, and the Archbishop, D. Fr. Manoel do
Cenaculo Villas Boas, the other, a man then in
extreme old age, distinguished for his erudition
and his exemplary virtues. Circular letters were
dispatched to all the other Juntas in Alem-Tejo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
requiring a recognition, and the troops which
had been embodied were ordered to Evora. Before
the new machine of government could be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 118–126.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

put in motion, Loison had crossed the Tagus on
his way to destroy it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison sent into Alem-Tejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the contempt with which the
French government, and its agents in Portugal,
regarded the Portugueze, Junot knew how easily
brave men might be made good soldiers, under
due instruction; and he seems to have apprehended,
that better officers would be found to
train and command them than either Portugal
or Spain at that time could supply. He apprehended
that the force in Alem-Tejo would soon
become strong enough not only to seize Setubal,
but to occupy the heights of Almada, and render
useless all the batteries on the left bank of the
Tagus; while at the same time another division
of their troops, acting higher up the river, would
co-operate with the insurgents from Coimbra.
To prevent this combination, he resolved to attack
the weaker and nearer body first. For this
purpose Loison had been recalled from Leiria,
Solignac and Margaron were placed under his
command, with 5000 men, and it was thought,
that after quelling the insurgents in Alem-Tejo,
he might send a supply of food to Lisbon,
especially of meat, ... victual Elvas, strike a blow
against the Spaniards at Badajoz, and then, recrossing
the Tagus at Santarem or Abrantes,
proceed against Coimbra; operations from which,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
at any time, in case of need, he could speedily
turn back to join the main body of the French
at Lisbon. There was, in fact, so little combination

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 156.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

among the Portugueze at this time, that
the insurgents in the northern provinces, and
those in Alem-Tejo, knew nothing whatever of
each other’s proceedings, and the first news
which reached the latter of the insurrection at
Porto was communicated to the people of Sines
by an English frigate.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He advances against Evora.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first tidings of Loison’s movement which
reached Evora were, that he had crossed the Tagus,
and was in full march towards that city. No
time was lost in transmitting this from Aldea
Gallega; any previous intelligence had been
rendered impossible by the secrecy with which
the French prepared their measures. Moretti
applied for reinforcements to Badajoz; orders
were sent for the forces from Campo-Mayor and
the other places in the north of the province, to
hasten to Evora, and General Galluzo was requested
to occupy the posts which would be left
unprotected by their absence; but no assistance
came from Badajoz, and Galluzo, instead of acting
as was expected, forbade the Portugueze to
leave Campo-Mayor. An advanced guard of
700 men had been stationed at Montemor o
Novo, twenty miles from the city. General
Leite ordered 400 men to reinforce this post.
They met the corps which they had been sent
to support in full retreat, the commander, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
knowing that succours were on the way to him,
having thought himself too weak to await<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> an
attack. Instead of deriving confidence or hope
from the meeting, they hastened to Evora, and
entered the city in alarm, exclaiming that they
were betrayed. That cry, in such miserable
times, is sure to be eagerly taken up. The
people had been assured that the French who
were coming against them did not exceed 800
men; this had been said either in a most erroneous
policy, to keep up the spirits of the inhabitants,
by deceiving them as to the extent of their
danger; or more probably in good faith, all ranks
being credulous in believing what they wished;
the natural effect, when the truth now became
known, was to give the populace apparent ground
for believing the vague charge of treason; their
tumultuous movements were with difficulty suppressed,
and the Corregedor found himself so
marked an object of suspicion, that, in the hope
of securing himself, he secretly left the city.
Order being in some degree restored, piquets of
cavalry and patroles were stationed for the night.
In the morning a company of Miquelets arrived
from Villa-Viçosa (that term having been borrowed
from the Catalans), and the legion of
Foreign Volunteers in the Spanish service, under
Sargento-Mor D. Antonio Maria Gallego: both<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
came by forced marches; the latter had left Jurumenha
the preceding evening, a distance of
four-and-forty miles. With these succours the
whole force collected then amounted to 1770

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 126–131.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

men, of whom about half were regular troops,
the others being volunteers newly-raised and undisciplined.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Evora.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The city of Evora is so ancient, that fabulous
history has laid its foundation more than two
thousand years before the Christian era. Certain
it is, that it was a flourishing city in the days of
Viriatus. Sertorius chose it for his residence;
some of the buildings with which he adorned it
are still remaining, and the inhabitants are still
supplied with water by his aqueduct, which
Joam III. repaired. Cæsar made it a municipal
town, and from him it was called Liberalitas
Julia. Under the Visigoths it continued to
flourish, and Sisebut coined money there. It
was recovered from the Moors in the reign of
Affonso Henriquez, the first king, by the romantic
enterprise of Giraldo the Fearless, then
an outlaw. King Fernando rebuilt or repaired
its walls; and Cardinal Henrique founded an
university and established an Inquisition there;
but the university had been suppressed. In the
war of the Restoration it was besieged and taken
by D. Juan de Austria, but it was soon recovered,
and the Spaniards in retreating toward their own
frontier suffered one of the most signal defeats
which they sustained during that long contest.
Its population, once amounting to 40,000, had declined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
to about half that number at the beginning
of the eighteenth century; since which time it
had varied so little, that there had neither been
any apparent diminution nor increase. The city
was populous enough to have defeated the force
which was now marching against it, if it had
been prepared for a Zaragozan defence. There
is courage enough for any thing in the Portugueze
character; but that individual and commanding
genius was wanting by which alone the
inhabitants of a large city can be made to act
steadily with one will, and thereby capable of
heroic valour. They prepared for a military defence
in the field, which was exposing peasantry
and half-disciplined troops to certain defeat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Action before the city.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">July 29.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>About seven in the morning the vedettes announced
that the enemy were in sight, and the
Portugueze took their ground in better order
than might have been expected, considering the
alarm and insubordination which had lately prevailed,
and the real inequality of the contest.
Their right rested upon the Mill of S. Bento,
about a mile from the city, the centre was
posted upon the hill of S. Caetano, the left
rested upon the Quinta dos Cucos. Having
reconnoitred this position, Loison directed General
Solignac to attack the enemy’s right, and
Margaron to break the centre with one part of
his brigade, while the other attacked the left;
they were to unite behind the city, occupy the
roads to Arrayolos and Estremoz, and thus cut
off the fugitives from all retreat, the cavalry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
being ready for pursuit upon the right and left, ...
so sure and easy a victory was anticipated.
The action began about eleven. The Portugueze
had four four-pounders in their right
wing, one three-pounder in the centre, and two
howitzers in the left; there was no want of
artillerymen, and if the other troops had understood
their business and performed their duty
like these, the event might have been doubtful;
but the cavalry could not by any exertion of
their commanders be brought into action; they
hung back and retired, while the infantry stood
their ground. When the latter were defeated,
instead of flying, as the French had expected,
in all directions, they retreated into the town.
The defeat, however, was thought so irreparable,
that General Leite and his staff made the best of
their way to Olivença, and Moretti hastened to
the Archbishop, to bid him provide for saving his
own life without delay, in the imminent danger
which threatened it. The venerable prelate
calmly told him in reply, to think of preserving
his own, which might yet be useful and honourable
to his country; for himself, he said, the
remainder of his days, few and useless as they
needs must be, did not deserve a thought. The
city had five gates, three of which had been
walled up; the breaches which time had made
in the walls had also been closed, but the walls
were old and ruinous, and the French forced
their entrance at many points, and then most of
the defendants took flight: ... Moretti and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 132–138.

Spaniards to Jurumenha, the company from
Villa-Viçosa to their own town; others dispersed;
time was gained for them by the resistance
which Lieutenant-Colonel Franco made
at one of the gates, and the brave conduct of the
foreign volunteers under<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>Gallego, who fought
desperately in the streets, and suffered great
loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The city taken.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The horrors which ensued will be remembered
in Portugal while any record of past times shall
be preserved there. Though even a military pretext
was wanting for delivering up the city and
the inhabitants to the will of the soldiers, the
whole proceedings of the Portugueze and their
Spanish allies having been those of regular war,
to them it was abandoned. A resolution had
been taken in the Junta that those persons who
feared the event should provide for their safety
by retiring in time; ... from some unexplained
cause, most probably from a well-grounded fear
that any persons who attempted to remove would
be regarded as traitors by the furious populace,
few or none availed themselves of this ominous
warning; when it was too late great numbers
got over the walls, but the French horse surrounded
the city, and showed as little mercy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
the fugitives without, as the infantry did to the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Inhumanity of the conquerors.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

inhabitants within. The convents and churches
afforded no asylum; not those who had borne
arms alone, but children and old men, were massacred,
and women were violated and slaughtered.
The lowest computation makes the number of
these victims amount to 900. The clergy and
religioners were especial objects of vengeance:
they were literally hunted from their hiding-places
like wild beasts: eight-and-thirty were
butchered; among them was the Bishop of
Maranham. The Archbishop’s intercession with
Loison obtained only a promise that a stop
should be put to these enormities; no attempt
was made to restrain them that day, nor during
the whole night, nor till eleven on the following
morning, and then by an order of the General,
what he called the lawful pillage was declared to
be at an end; but he contented himself with

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 387.
<br />
Neves, iv. 138–142.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

issuing the order; no means for enforcing it
were taken, and the soldiers continued their abominations
till every place had been ransacked,
and their worst passions had been<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> glutted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alarm at Estremoz.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>According to the statement of the French,
8000 of the allies were killed or wounded in the
battle and in the capture of the city, and 4000
made prisoners, the latter being chiefly peasants.
Their own loss they stated at 90 killed, and more
than 200 wounded. The intimidation of that part
of the country which was within the immediate
reach of the victors was such as might be expected
after such a blow. At the first rumour
that reached Estremoz, the populace became ungovernable;
their first impulse was that of rage,
which would willingly have found any victim on
which to sate itself. An officer had just arrived
from Portalegre; they fancied that he had prevented
the coming of some regular troops, which
they had looked for; an attempt was made to
murder him in the hall of the Junta, whither he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
fled for refuge, and in the presence of the members;
and there was no other means of saving
him but by concealing him from the ferocious
rabble. Presently a dispatch came, announcing
the total defeat at Evora, the capture of the city,
and the loss of every thing. Such was the temper
of the people, that it was a service of the utmost
danger to communicate this news; and the member
who attempted to read the dispatch to them
from a varanda found his life in danger, and drew
back. But it was not possible either to conceal
the fatal intelligence or to delay it. Estremoz
would assuredly be the next object of the enemy,
and Evora was only six leagues distant; if they
had hitherto dreamt of defending the town, the
fate of Evora was now before their eyes: they
knew that even the unreasonable multitude would
feel this near and imminent danger, though they
would not endure to be told of it; and the members
of the Junta determined to take measures for
immediate submission. The melancholy manner
with which they passed through the crowd confirmed
the worst apprehensions of the people;
and as they went along they spake each to those
persons on whose prudence he could rely, telling
them what had occurred, and what must now of
necessity be done; thus they thought the news
might pass from one to another with the least
danger, and every one take such measures for
himself as he deemed best. There was a cry of
treason at first, when it was seen that of the three
guns which had been mounted to defend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
walls, one was cast into the ditch, and the other
two sent off to Olivença. The Juiz de Fora became
the object of suspicion, and could he have
been found at that moment, would have been
murdered; ... so fickle is popular feeling, that
this very man was presently sought for as the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 145–149.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

fittest person to give counsel. A meeting was
held, and a messenger deputed to solicit Loison’s
clemency.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison proceeds to Elvas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Loison received the messenger well, thinking
that severity enough had been shown to secure
the submission of Alem-Tejo. He constituted
a provisional government in Evora, at the head
of which the Archbishop was compelled to act,
and he set off for Estremoz on the fourth day

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

after the action. He raised no contributions
there, permitted no pillage, and paid for every
thing which the troops consumed; he also set
at liberty some of his prisoners. But when he
proceeded to Elvas he ordered two Swiss prisoners
to be shot, condemned four others to work
in chains for five years, threw the Spanish commander
Gallego into a dungeon, and condemned
the Portugueze Lieut.-Colonel Franco to death,
for bearing arms against the French. The Bishop
of Elvas interceded earnestly for this officer, and
finding all intercession vain, concluded by saying,
if this favour were refused him, he had still one
to ask, which was, that the General would sentence
him to the same fate, seeing life would be
hateful to him if he could not save his countryman
under such circumstances. Loison was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>

Neves, iv. 149, 156–158.
<br />
Observador Portuguez, 397.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

touched at this, and revoked the order for execution.
That General has left a name in Portugal
which will be execrated to the latest generations;
here, however, is an instance which
evinces some sense of generosity, as if his heart
had not been naturally bad; but it was the tendency
of the Revolution, and of Buonaparte’s
system, to make men wicked whom it did not
find so.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Loison enters Portalegre.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The less portable part of the plunder of Evora
was sold at Elvas, a sort of fair being held for the
purpose; and many persons purchased church
vessels for the sake of restoring them to the altars
from whence they had been taken. Loison made
a movement upon Badajoz, and believing that
the troops in that city had been called off to
the Spanish armies, and that his recent success
had occasioned great consternation there, endeavoured
to introduce officers under a flag of truce,
for the purpose of observing the state of the
place; but they were refused admittance. The
commandant of Elvas, Colonel Miquel, had made
himself odious in that city, especially for executing
a German as an emissary of the Spaniards,
the main proof against him being some thirty
pieces of gold which were found in his possession.
Some fugitives from Elvas, with a few
comrades from Campo-Mayor, waylaid this commandant
as he went from the city, intending to
sleep in Fort La Lippe, for greater security;
they fired upon him and an officer in his company;
the officer escaped, but Miquel lay all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
night upon the ground, the soldiers not venturing
to seek him in the darkness, and being
removed to Lisbon, he died there of his wounds.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>He is recalled to the neighbourhood of Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

This was some days before Loison’s arrival. That
General appointed M. Girod de Novilard of the
engineers to succeed him, and marched upon
Portalegre. The Spaniards had already retired
from thence, and the Bishop, with most of the
principal persons, withdrew also in time. The
city was plundered, and a contribution of 100,000
cruzados demanded from the district; about
40,000 were raised, and six persons were carried
away as pledges for the remainder. He then

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 156–164.
<br />
Thiebault, 168–172.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

marched for Abrantes, having received dispatches
which ordered him to hasten his return toward
Lisbon by that route, it being now certain that
an expedition from England was off the coast.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Insubordination of the people at Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Those provinces, meantime, which had not
felt the vengeance of the French were in a state
of anarchy. The temporary dissolution of order,
even though no revolutionary opinions were at
work, produced evils little less alarming than the
actual presence of the enemy. The cry of an
inflamed multitude is always for blood. The
Intendant of Police at Porto addressed a manly
proclamation to the people, reproving them for
eagerly demanding the death of a few suspected
persons, who were already in the hands of justice,
and from whom they had nothing to fear. In
the processes against them, he said, there ought
to be nothing precipitate, nothing that could be
accused of inhumanity; he must see that all the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
proofs of their guilt were brought forward, that
his own honour might suffer no stain. If they
were dissatisfied with him, he would gladly lay
down an office which he had never solicited;
more willingly would he accompany his son to
the army, than occupy a station for which, even
in quiet times, he should have thought himself
unqualified; and though life was dear to him, he
would rather lose it in the service of his country
than in a tumult. But mobs are as seldom capable
of reason as of compunction. It was necessary,
for the sake of preventing wider evils, to
accelerate the processes, and to promise blood.
No person, however innocent of any connexion
with the French, however distinguished for his
exertions against them, was safe from suspicion;
no place, however sacred, was secure from search.
Upon a report that a suspected person had concealed
himself in a burial-vault, it was proposed
to open all the vaults in the church till he was
found. Upon another rumour that he was concealed
in a nun’s habit in a Carmelite nunnery,
the mob proposed to break in and examine the
sisterhood. Raymundo exerted himself to prevent
this scandalous outrage. Some one charged
him also with treason, and his life was for a moment
in danger. But Raymundo, who knew
how little in such times any popularity, however
deserved, was to be trusted, had provided himself
with a crucifix in case of need. He displayed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 209–224.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

it in this emergency, and by an exclamation
according with the display, induced the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
rabble to join with him in a shout of loyalty,
and succeeded in dissuading them from entering
the convent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Design of a military usurpation in that city.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Even in this early stage of popular commotions
a military usurpation is said to have been projected
by Luiz Candido Cordeiro Pinheiro Furtado,
in conjunction with Joam Manoel de Mariz.
Both were esteemed good officers; the latter was
a member of the Junta, the former offended that
he had not been nominated, and still more so
that another person had been made commander-in-chief.
They designed to erect a military Junta
under their own direction, and they proposed to
raise a corps under the name of the Loyal Porto
Legion, of which Candido was to have the command;
the officers were named, the uniform designed,
and worn by Candido with some of his associates;
he took to himself also a guard of honour,
which, from a small beginning, was gradually increased,
till at length the armed attendance with
which he always appeared in public was such as
to excite reasonable apprehension. The city was
in this state when Bernardim Freire arrived from
Coimbra to take upon himself the command. He
was received with great joy by the people; but
Luiz Candido was evidently displeased at his
coming, and Bernardim was soon apprised that
a conspiracy was formed against him and against
the Junta. He was careful therefore to keep
Candido and Mariz as much about his person
as possible. Among other precautions for
preserving tranquillity in the city, he ordered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
the guns to be unloaded; persons were not
wanting to represent this as being done with
a treacherous design; and a priest, notorious
for irregularities, at the head of a mob seized
his bridle, and exclaimed that the people would
have no such General. A dangerous stir had
already begun, when some men of better mind
came resolutely forward; one of them felled the
priest to the ground; Bernardim spake to the
crowd in a manner which conciliated their good

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 225–229.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

will, the priest was thrown into prison, and the
day was closed with an illumination in honour of
the General.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The conspirators are seized.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Upon the arrival of D. Miguel Pereira Forjaz
to assist his brother-in-law Bernardim, an attempt
was made to establish a military Junta, in aid of
the provisional government, and as a check upon
the designs of Candido and his associates. This,
however, proved ineffectual; and they proceeded
so rapidly in organizing an armed party, that it
was deemed necessary to secure Candido and
Mariz without delay, lest the city should become
a scene of bloodshed. They were accordingly
summoned to a consultation at the Bishop’s
palace, and there arrested. Their escort, which,
as usual, had accompanied them, began to express
displeasure at this; and three of the men
entering the palace, demanded insolently that
their commander should be delivered to them;
if he were innocent, they said, they would set
him at liberty; if he were a traitor, they would
blow him to pieces from the mouth of a cannon.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
These men were secured, and Raymundo, with
some other officers to whom this service had been
assigned, disarmed their fellows. The agitation,
however, continued the whole day, though this
was at an early hour; and it was not till after
midnight that the prisoners could be conducted
without danger of a rescue to the jail. They
were immediately proceeded against according
to the forms of Portugueze law, and the evidence
against them appeared so conclusive, that Candido
was condemned to death, and Mariz to be
degraded to Angola. The gallows accordingly
was erected, Candido was led into the oratory to
perform the last religious duties, the brethren of
the Misericordia went out to attend the execution,
and the crowd collected to witness it; when, after
a while, it was announced that the two prisoners
were removed to the fortress of S. Joam da Foz,
to be embarked for Brazil, and there placed at
the Prince’s disposal. So fickle is a multitude,
that the crowd, which a few days before had
almost mutinied because of the arrest of this
man, became riotous now because he was not
put to death. They were pacified by the personal
exertions of the Bishop and two of his
dignitaries, and by an official notification that
the Junta having pronounced sentence of death
against Luiz Candido upon full proof of a most

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 229–237.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

atrocious crime, had thought it proper to lay
the proceedings before the Prince, and remit
the criminal to his mercy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />July.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The populace at Porto were kept in some degree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
of submission by the vigorous measures of
the provisional government, the respect which
was paid to the episcopal character, and by the
influence which men of property possess in a

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disturbances at Braganza.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

flourishing commercial town. In remoter parts
the local authorities were weaker, and tumults
of the most disgraceful nature occurred. After
the provinces beyond the mountains and between
the rivers had been delivered from their
first danger, by the failure of Loison’s expedition
from Almeida, they were more seriously alarmed
from the side of Castille and Leon; and indeed
had it not been for the success of the Spaniards
in Andalusia, Junot would probably have received
powerful reinforcements from Marshal Bessieres
after the battle of Rio Seco. The first disturbances
arose at Braganza upon a rumour that this
army was approaching. The people gathered together
tumultuously, and when they learnt that
no enemies were near, directed their vengeance
against all whom they suspected; and in such
times it is in the power of any wretch, however
vile and worthless, to throw suspicion upon the
object of his envy or resentment. The Junta, in
hope of appeasing them, convoked a popular
meeting, ... the readiest means of showing them
their power, and teaching them how to abuse
it; and the result was, that most of the members
of the Junta were turned out, and such as the
mob thought fit elected in their places. A shoemaker,
and the keeper of a wine-house, who, because
he was maimed in one arm, called himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">o Loison Portuguez</i>, were the kings of the rabble.
The latter took upon himself the office of general,
and was actually obeyed by the troops. Their
chief vengeance was directed against the New-Christians,
for Pombal’s law (the redeeming act
of that tyrannical statesman) had not even in
half a century produced a feeling of toleration
in the populace. Any accusation, however preposterous,
was believed; they gutted the house
of one man, and threw him into prison, upon
a charge of witchcraft, for having, it was said,
made an image of General Sepulveda, and placed
it over the fire in a frying-pan. When the city had
thus continued three days under mob-rule, the
magistrates took courage from despair, arrested
the ruling demagogues during the night, and
sent them prisoners to Chaves. Troops came
from Villa Real, where Sepulveda at that time
was, and tranquillity was restored; but it was
necessary to gratify the people by making useless
preparations for defence; and the popular
opinion was, that nothing but what was right
had been done, that the persons whose property
had been destroyed, and their lives endangered,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 238–245.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

deserved the usage they had suffered, and that
the magistrates were bribed by the Jews.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The New-Christians plundered at Villa Nova de Foz-Coa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>More serious disturbances occurred at Villa
Nova de Foz-Coa, arising from the same popular
intolerance and love of rapine. That town, one
of the most flourishing in Beira Alta, owed in
great part its prosperity to its position at the
confluence of the Coa with the Douro. A considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
trade in silk, and in rice, salt-fish, and
other articles of foreign importation, brought
thither by the river from Porto, was carried on
with the adjacent country, and with the Spaniards
of the border. This trade was mostly in
the hands of persons who, because they were of
Jewish extraction, were believed by the vulgar
to be still attached in heart to the Mosaic law.
The cry of Down with the French, was coupled
here with Kill the Jews; ... their houses were
attacked, their goods plundered, their persons
abused, their lives threatened and seriously endangered,
and more than twenty of the wealthiest
families in that country reduced to utter ruin by
the complete destruction of their property. Some
of these unhappy persons effected their escape
to Moncorvo; and, because they were protected
there, and the Junta of that town endeavoured
to restore order at Villa Nova, hostilities ensued
between the two townships. The evil spread;
and if the Junta of Moncorvo had not arrested
during the night some movers of sedition in their
town, and seized also some of the ringleaders
from Villa Nova, who had crossed the Douro,
the province of Tras os Montes would soon have
suffered all the evils of civil war, exasperated by
a spirit of fanaticism, such as existed in the worst
ages of superstition and ignorance. The New-Christians
were accused of assisting the French
with money, blaspheming God, cursing the Prince,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 245–263.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

defiling the crucifix, and finally, of Manicheism!
When a judicial inquiry was afterwards instituted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
concerning the riots, depositions to this effect
were made against them upon oath!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Troubles at Viseu.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The troubles at Viseu, though less destructive
in their consequences, assumed a more revolutionary
character. The mob insisted upon
having a Juiz do Povo, and elected a demagogue
to that office, which had not before been
known among them, which in quiet times is useless,
and in turbulent ones dangerous. Florencio
José Correa de Mello, the general of the province,
and the Bishop, a good but timid man, instead
of refusing to acknowledge this tumultuous
and illegal appointment, ratified it by administering
an oath to the chosen favourite of the mob,
who from that moment became a person of more
authority than either Bishop or General. The
latter offended the military by refusing to double
their pay, as had been so imprudently done at
Porto; on this account they became mutinous,
and a riot broke out in the city upon an absurd
report that Loison was come to visit him. The
demagogue, who was lord of the day, obtained
from the intimidated Bishop an order for his
arrest, his house was sacked, and he and the
Juiz de Fora were thrown into prison amid the
insults of a multitude who knew not what they
did. A meeting of the people was then held, at
which the magistrates were deposed, new ones

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 263–273.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

appointed, and the Bishop was declared Generalissimo,
with Silveira, who happened to be
passing through Viseu, for his adjutant-general.</p>

<p>Proceedings equally outrageous, and of more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
perilous tendency, occurred in the town of Arcos
de Val de Vez. The bells in that town and in
the surrounding villages rung the alarm upon
a report that 20,000 French had landed at
Espozende, and were entering Ponte de Lima.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Riotous proceedings at Arcos de Val de Vez.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

A disorderly multitude collected, and set out in
search of the enemy; their courage was easily
roused, and soon spent; for when they had ascertained
that the report was without foundation,
and were returning home, they learnt that
a body of men from the north were in possession
of their town, and instead of hastening thither to
protect their property, and restore order, they
took to flight, each seeking a place of refuge
where he thought best. The people in fear of
whom they fled were peasantry, who, like themselves,
had set out to fight the French, in utter disorder;
hurrying along in scattered parties, some
with a soldier for their leader, some with an
abbot, provided neither with ammunition nor
bread, increasing their numbers as they went
along, and expecting that the magistrates were
to issue orders for supplying them wherever they
came. The <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Vereadores</i> exerted themselves to
feed this rabble, and be rid of them; the Juiz
de Fora, dismayed at such a visitation, and in
despair of satisfying such visitors, absconded,
and his disappearance was imputed to a consciousness
of treason. While they were seeking
him every where, an unlucky messenger entered
the town with dispatches from the Corregedor of
Barcellos, and as he happened to have lost an arm,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
the senseless multitude took him for Loison; and
even when they had examined his papers were
still so possessed with this preposterous notion,
that they placed him in confinement. Another
messenger with letters fell into their hands, and
was seized in like manner; and they were demanding
a warrant for the apprehension of the
Juiz de Fora, when he was brought in from the
country, by an inhuman rabble, in a condition
which would have excited pity in the poor unthinking
wretches themselves who were his tormentors,
if they had beheld him separately, and
if men did not seem to be divested of all compassion
when they act in mobs. With great difficulty
they were prevailed upon not to finish
killing him, but to lodge him in prison. Presently
the thirst for blood returned, and they
ordered a young priest to go and prepare him
for death. The priest objected that he had not
yet received that order in the church which
empowered him to officiate in the sacrament of
confession; upon which they replied, that they

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 279–287.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

conferred the order. The young man then entered
the prison, and with great presence of
mind advised the Juiz to feign himself dead;
then going out, he asked the mob, with a tone
of anger, why they had sent him to confess a
man whom they had already killed? They made
no farther inquiry; ... the bells tolled for his
death, and by this artifice his life was saved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The rabble enact laws.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The rabble now took upon themselves to reform
the state; they began by turning out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
members of the Camara, throwing the chairs out
of window, demolishing the seat of the Judge,
and burning the public papers. They displaced
officers, deposed two or three abbots, and nominated
a Capuchin friar to be their General.
They appointed a Junta, and made laws whereby
they abolished the recruiting system, fixed the
prices of milk, meat, and wine, prohibited the
exportation of bread, forbade all processes for
debt, suspended all law-suits during the war, abolished
the fees of the parochial priests, and were
hardly persuaded to spare the tithes, and, finally,
exempted all tenants from payment of manorial
rights; and these laws were enacted not for their
own district alone, but for the whole kingdom.
This was the only indication of a revolutionary
disposition which manifested itself during these
unhappy times. By good hap the persons whom
they had chosen to form their Junta were prudent
and well-intentioned men, who temporized
with them, and accepted an illegal authority in
the hope of restoring order. The anniversary of
a religious procession occurred at this time, and
they took advantage of it. The Host was borne
through the streets, a sermon adapted to the circumstances
was preached with good effect, and
the reformers, tired of their work, and willing to
secure what they had gained by pillage, broke
up, and returned to their own part of the country.
The people of the land then enrolled themselves,
established patroles, and subjected themselves to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 287–293.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

good discipline; so that when a second visit of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
the same kind was attempted, they seized the
ringleaders. Troops at length came from Viana,
and many of the criminals were apprehended and
sent prisoners to Porto.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Communication between Alem-Tejo and the northern provinces.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The authority of the provisional government
at Porto would not have been generally acknowledged,
and with so little reluctance, throughout
these provinces, if that city had not been looked
to as a capital, because of its great commercial
importance. But so little intercourse was there
between the north and south of Portugal, that
both had been in insurrection against the French
more than a month, before it was known in one
part that any resistance had commenced in the
other. Vague reports indeed were in circulation,
which could be traced to no authentic source;
but no intelligence upon which any reliance was
placed arrived in Alem-Tejo, till a student from
Coimbra, who had enlisted in the academic corps,
came to Campo-Mayor on his own concerns, and
gave a clear account of the transactions in which

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

he had borne a part. The news was immediately
dispatched to Badajoz; tidings of the battle of
Baylen reached that city at the same time; and
messengers, accredited by the governors of Badajoz
and Campo-Mayor, were sent to Coimbra,
to communicate the joyful accounts from Spain.
They were received not merely with transports
of exultation, but with as much surprise, says
the Portugueze historian of these events, as if
they had come from another world, ... in such
utter ignorance were the people of Beira of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
what had been going on in Alem-Tejo, though
the two provinces, along an extent of some forty
miles, are only separated by the Tagus. The
messengers on their part with equal surprise
learnt that the legitimate government was restored
in Tras os Montes, and Entre Douro e
Minho. Being thus referred to Porto, thither
they proceeded; and returned from thence with
letters from the Bishop and the General to the
Archbishop of Evora and the Junta of Badajoz,
recommending the establishment of a provisional
government under the Archbishop, similar to
that at Porto, that the same system might be
pursued in the south as in the north. When they
reached Coimbra on their way, they learnt the fate
of Evora, that news having been circulated by
the French without delay. Proceeding on their
journey, when they drew near Castello-Branco
they found the roads full of fugitives, removing
with their children and families, and such goods
as they could carry away, in fear of Loison, so
far had the terror of his name extended. It was
not then known that he had marched toward
Abrantes; and the messengers, to avoid the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 197–205.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

danger of falling in with his troops, entered
Spain by Zebreira, and so proceeded to Badajoz
and Campo-Mayor.</p>

<p>Things were in this state when a British expedition
arrived upon the north coast. General
Leite was collecting at Olivença the troops which
had escaped from Evora. The Conde de Castro-Marim
was raising and embodying forces in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Algarve; and the Junta of Porto were hardly
less perplexed by the perilous spirit of insubordination
which prevailed both in the city and
in the remoter parts of the provinces, than by
the deficiency of money and means for the men
who willingly came forward to serve against the
invaders. There were numbers, and courage, and
good will, but every thing else was wanting.</p>

CONVENTION OF CINTRA.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.</span>State of public feeling in England.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="firstword">These</span> transactions in Spain and Portugal excited
the deepest interest in the English people;
not so much for the hope, which had thus unexpectedly
arisen, of advantages to England, and
to the general welfare of Europe, as for the nature
of the contest, their detestation of the unequalled
iniquity by which it had been provoked,
and their sympathy in the instinct and principle
by which it was carried on. Every day seemed
lost till an army of our own should be co-operating
with men engaged in a cause so sacred,
so congenial to the feelings of a Briton. Such
was the eagerness to participate in the glorious
struggle, that the militia almost universally
offered themselves for foreign service, and the
country with one voice called for an effort equal
to the occasion. But the Government was not
prepared for such exertions. Our military operations
had never yet been carried on upon a scale
such as was now required, and since the peace
of Amiens they had been almost wholly suspended.
Though great and most essential improvements
in the army had been steadily and
unostentatiously carried into effect by the Duke<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
of York, much remained to be done; and it
wanted that efficiency which nothing but experience
could give it. That our troops were
able to beat the enemy wherever they should
meet on equal terms, or even with considerable
advantage of numbers on the enemy’s side, no
Englishman doubted, unless he wished the enemy
success; but the public confidence went no
farther. The war had on our part so long been
almost exclusively maritime, that the army had
suffered something in reality and more in reputation.
The French, always fond of war, had
become a military people; their military establishment
was supposed to be perfect in all its
branches, their troops experienced, their officers
excellent, their commanders of the highest celebrity:
to oppose them we had generals very
few of whom had ever been tried in command,
and officers of whom the far greater number, like
their men, had never seen an enemy in the field.
A great effort, however, was now called for by
our new allies. The Spanish Juntas with which
the British Government had hitherto communicated,
preferred assistance in money and supplies
to an auxiliary force; they had a brave but undue
confidence in their own strength, and perhaps
they foresaw that mutual ill will might probably
arise between combined armies whose habits and
prejudices were widely dissimilar. What they
desired was, that a British expedition should be
employed against the French in Portugal; this
would act as a powerful diversion in favour of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
Spain; thither we were called by the wishes and
groans of the Portugueze people; and it was
believed, that when the deliverance of that kingdom
should have been effected, a plan of co-operation
with the Spaniards might be arranged.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>An expedition ordered to the coast of Portugal.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When the insurrection of the Spaniards began,
an armament was preparing at Cork, which, as
different prospects opened upon us, had been
supposed to be intended at one time against
Ceuta, at another for South America. Its destination
was now fixed for the Peninsula, and the
command was given to Lieutenant-General Sir
Arthur Wellesley. His instructions were, while
the fleet proceeded off Cape Finisterre, to make
for Coruña himself, and consult there with the
Provisional Government of Galicia. He was
authorized to give the most distinct assurances
to the Spanish and Portugueze people, that his
Majesty, in sending a force to their assistance,
had no other object in view than to afford them
his most unqualified and disinterested support.
In all questions respecting their provisional government,
should any such arise, he was as far
as possible to avoid taking any part; maintaining
only these principles, that no act done by Charles
or Ferdinand could be considered valid, unless
they returned to their own country, and were
absolutely free agents there; and that the entire
evacuation of the Peninsula by the French was
the only basis upon which the Spaniards should
be induced to treat. In any arrangements he
was directed to act with the utmost liberality<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
and confidence, the object of Great Britain being
to assist the people of Spain and Portugal in restoring
and maintaining against France the independence
and integrity of their respective
monarchies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Former services of Sir A. Wellesley.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Arthur Wellesley, fourth son of Viscount
Wellesley, Earl of Mornington, was born in the
year 1769, at Dengan Castle, in Ireland, the
seat of his ancestors. After having been a short
time at Eton, he was removed, while very young,
to the military academy at Angers; for there
was not at that time any institution in Great
Britain wherein tactics were taught, and the
youth who meant to follow the military profession
was obliged to go to France if he wished
to learn the elements of war. He obtained his
first commission about the age of eighteen, in
the 41st regiment; and after a series of exchanges
and promotions, his elder brother, afterwards
Marquis Wellesley, purchased for him the
lieutenant-colonelcy of the 33rd, in 1793. He
conducted himself in the disastrous retreat from
Holland so as to obtain much praise from military
men. In 1795 he embarked for service in the
West Indies, but being providentially driven
back by storms, his destination was altered. In
1797 he went out to India with his brother Lord
Mornington, then Governor General; there he
distinguished himself in the war against Tippoo,
and being appointed Governor of Seringapatam
after the capture of that city, and one of the
commissioners for disposing of the conquered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
territories, he discharged his arduous duties in
such manner as to deserve and obtain the gratitude
of the conquered people. In the subsequent
war against the Mahrattas he commanded
at the battle of Assye, against an army exceeding
his own number in the proportion of ten to one;
and whose disciplined troops, under French
officers, more than doubled the British force.
The action was severe beyond all former example
in India: having won the enemy’s artillery, consisting
of an hundred pieces, which were served
with perfect skill, he had to take them a second
time with the bayonet, when men who had feigned
death rose from the ground and turned them
upon the conquerors as they pressed forward in
pursuit. The victory was decisive; the success
was followed up, and at the close of that triumphant
war a monument in honour of the battle was
erected at Calcutta; the inhabitants of that city
presented him with a sword, and his own officers
with a golden vase; the thanks of parliament
were voted him, and he was made a Knight
Companion of the Bath. He returned to England
in 1805; took his seat in the House of
Commons the ensuing year, as member for Newport
in the Isle of Wight, and in 1807 was appointed
Chief Secretary in Ireland. But his
military services were soon required; he accompanied
Lord Cathcart in the expedition
against Copenhagen, and commanded in the only
affair of importance which took place. He was
now to be tried in more arduous undertakings;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
and such was the repute in which his talents
were held, that when the armament for the
Peninsula was placed under his command, the
opinion both of the army and of the public
entirely accorded with the choice which Government
had made.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir Arthur lands at Coruña.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir Arthur Wellesley, having about ten thousand
men under his command, sailed from Cork
on the 12th of July, and leaving the fleet as soon
as he had seen it clear of the coast, made sail in
a frigate for Coruña, and arrived there on the
20th. There the Junta of Galicia informed him
of the battle of Rio Seco; and that the French,
being, in consequence, masters of the course of
the Douro, were enabled to cut off the communication
between that province and the country to
the south and east. The French in Portugal
they estimated at 15,000, of whom 12,000 were
supposed to be at Lisbon; and he was told that
the Portugueze troops at Porto amounted to
10,000, and that a Spanish corps of 2000 had
begun their march for that city on the 15th, and
were expected to arrive there about the 25th.
Sir Arthur consulted with them concerning the
immediate employment of his army. They explicitly
stated that they were in no need of men,
but wanted arms, ammunition, and money: ...
this latter want was relieved by the arrival of
£200,000 from England that very day. They
strongly recommended him to employ his forces
against the enemy in Portugal, because while
that army remained unbroken the Spaniards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
could never make any simultaneous effort to
drive the French out of the Peninsula; and they
advised him to land in the north, that he might
bring forward and avail himself of the Portugueze
troops in that quarter.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He proceeds to Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Accordingly Sir Arthur sailed for Porto, ordering
the fleet to follow him. He arrived there
the 24th, and had a conference that night with
the Bishop and the general officers. From them,
and from Lieutenant-colonel Brown, who had
previously joined them, he learnt that the regular
Portugueze troops who had been collected
amounted to 5000 men, and were posted at Coimbra;
that there were about 1200 peasants in
advance, and a corps of 2500 Portugueze and
300 Spanish infantry at Porto, besides volunteers
and peasants; but all were badly equipped and
armed, the peasantry having only pikes. It was
concerted that the 5000 should co-operate with
him, and the remainder with the Spanish corps,
then, so the Spaniards had informed him, on its
way from Galicia; and that the peasantry should
be employed, part in the blockade of Almeida,
part in the defence of Tras os Montes, which
province was supposed to be threatened by
Bessieres, in consequence of his victory at Rio
Seco. Sir Arthur stated, that he should want
cattle for draught, and for the supply of his
army; the Bishop took pen and ink, wrote down
the number which would be required, and replied
immediately that they were ready.</p>

<p>Here Sir Arthur received a letter from Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Charles Cotton, advising him to leave the troops
either at Porto or at the mouth of the Mondego,
and proceed to communicate with him off Lisbon.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>He goes to the Tagus to confer with Sir C. Cotton.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The fleet accordingly was ordered to Mondego
Bay, and the general proceeded to confer
with Sir Charles. There he found dispatches
from General Spencer, stating that he had landed
his corps in Andalusia, at the request of the
Junta of Seville; but that he had resisted the
applications made to him to join Castaños, thinking
it advisable to preserve his force unbroken,
for the purpose of acting with Sir Arthur. He
had, however, consented to take up a position at
Xeres, where he might serve as a point of support
for Castaños, in case of defeat, and from
whence he could re-embark in eight-and-forty
hours: and he supposed that Sir Arthur would
begin his campaign at Cadiz, implying an opinion
that Dupont could not be defeated without
English assistance. Sir Arthur, however, being
convinced by the Junta of Galicia that his army
would be employed with more advantage to the
common cause against Junot, ordered General
Spencer to join him off the coast of Portugal,
unless he should be actually engaged in operations
which he could not relinquish without injury
to the Spaniards.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Mondego the only place where a landing could be effected.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>General Spencer represented Junot’s force as
exceeding 20,000 men: the admiral, according
to the reports of the Portugueze, estimated them
at less: Sir Arthur concluded that they were
from 16,000 to 18,000, of whom about 12,000<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
were at Lisbon, and in its vicinity, and 2400 at
Alcobaça. Any attempt at landing in the Tagus
was considered impracticable: it would be equally
so at Cascaes: it was at all times difficult to land
an army in the small bays near the rock, and
would be now especially dangerous because of
the neighbourhood of the enemy: Peniche was
garrisoned by the French. There was therefore
no choice but to disembark in the Mondego.
Thither Sir Arthur returned. He rejoined the
fleet there on the 30th, and there he found intelligence
of the defeat of Dupont, and advice
from his own government, that he would be
reinforced immediately with 5000 men, under
Brigadier-General Acland, and afterwards with
10,000 who had been under Sir John Moore in
Sweden, the command being vested in Sir Hew
Dalrymple; but he was directed to carry into
execution without delay the instructions which
he had received, if he thought himself sufficiently
strong. He also received accounts that Loison
had been detached from Lisbon, to open the
communication with Elvas, the patriots in Alem-Tejo
having been joined by about a thousand
men from the Spanish army of Estremadura, and
being now formidable.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Troops landed in the Mondego.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">1808.<br />August.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This latter account made him conclude that
there was no danger of being attacked by superior
numbers before his reinforcements reached
him; and he determined to land, both for the
sake of the troops, and because he knew that
the Portugueze, who were much discouraged at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
seeing the men remain so long on board after
their arrival in Mondego Bay, would suspect
either the inclination of the English to contend
with the French, or their ability, if the landing
were still deferred. It was now found that the
Coimbra students had performed a service of real
importance in winning Figueira from the enemy;
the landing in the Mondego being so difficult,
that with all the zeal and ability of the navy, it
would have been impossible to effect it without
the cordial assistance of the Portugueze. They
began to disembark on the first of August. The
weather was so little favourable, and the surf so
high, that the whole of the troops were not
landed till the 5th, and on that day General
Spencer arrived, his corps following him the
next. He had embarked immediately upon
learning the surrender of Dupont, not waiting
for instructions. This corps was disembarked
on the 7th and 8th, on which night the whole
army were in readiness to advance: the march
of the main body was, however, delayed till the
10th, at the desire of the Portugueze general
officers. Sir Arthur conferred with them at
Montemor o Velho, and arranged the plan of
operations: he armed and inspected their troops,
recommended and superintended their organization,
and offered as large a sum as his military
funds could afford, to defray the expenses of
their equipment: this, however, was declined by
their officers. While the troops were landing, a
party of the police cavalry arrived at Coimbra,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
having effected their escape from Lisbon. This
hazardous attempt was planned and conducted
by Eliziario de Carvalho. A serjeant, by name
Gamboa, as soon as their flight was discovered,
was dispatched to the French commander at
Santarem, with orders to intercept and make an
example of them, according to the system of the
French tyranny. Gamboa, however, with the
party under his command, followed and joined
his countrymen; and they accomplished their
dangerous march in safety.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They advance to Leiria.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir Arthur determined to march along the road
nearest the sea, for the sake of communicating
with the store-ships; but as this communication
must needs be very precarious, both as depending
upon the state of the surf, and also because
the army might find it expedient to strike more
into the country, arrangements were made for
taking with them sufficient stores to last till they
should reach the Tagus. The advanced guard
marched on the 9th, supported by the brigades
under Generals Hill and Ferguson. Laborde
and Thomieres had collected their corps, to the
amount of from 5000 to 6000 men, in the neighbourhood
of Leiria; they threatened the magazines
formed in that city for the Portugueze
army; and Sir Arthur was urged to advance as
speedily as possible, for the sake of preserving
them. The main body followed on the 10th: on
that day Sir Arthur received advices from Coruña,
informing him that neither Blake nor
Cuesta was in a condition to act offensively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
against Bessieres, nor to follow him, if he should
enter Portugal. But at the same time news arrived
of the flight of the Intruder from Madrid;
and Sir Arthur perceived that Bessieres would be
more solicitous to cover his retreat towards the
French frontier, than to attempt a diversion in
favour of Junot. At all events, there was time
enough for his operations against the latter before
Bessieres could arrive; and it was to be expected
that General Acland, or Sir John Moore, would
land before he could come up. These advices,
therefore, only determined him to follow up with
the utmost celerity the plan which he had concerted.
On the 11th the main body joined the
advanced guard at Leiria, and the next day the
Portugueze force, consisting of 6000 men, including
600 cavalry, arrived, the whole force
being now collected there. When the English
advanced guard entered that city, they found in
one of the convents the dead bodies of several
monks who had been murdered by the French;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Early Campaigns of the Duke of Wellington, p. 8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the murderers had amused themselves with dipping
their hands in the blood of these victims,
and printing the red mark upon the wall.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Joy of the Portugueze in Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The arrival of the British troops in Portugal
had the immediate effect of putting an end to
that anarchy which had already produced so much
evil in the northern provinces. Meantime the
wildest reports were afloat at Lisbon. The miserable
people looking every where for deliverance,
believed that an army from Morocco was
coming to their aid. The trick of the egg was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
repeated, not as before, with mysterious initials,
referring to King Sebastian, but with a distinct
annunciation that the French were speedily to
be destroyed. The egg thus inscribed was found

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, v. 67.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

upon the high altars of the Patriarchal Church:
but the former instance had led the French to
discover the easy process by which an inscription
in relief may be produced, and on the following
morning eggs with a counter prophecy,
in the same fashion, were to be seen upon the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 170.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

high altar in every church in Lisbon: at the same
time a paper was fixed up, explaining the trick.
This was fair matter of mirth for the day; but
Junot and his officers well knew that the hostile
prediction was not made now without a reasonable
and near prospect of its fulfilment; and very
soon intelligence came that the only foe of which

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, v. 62, 65.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

he stood in fear had actually disembarked. The
Portugueze commanders at Coimbra and Pombal
used their utmost endeavours that no information
of the British movements might reach the
enemy, and in this they were assisted by the
disposition of the people. But entire concealment
was not possible; ... the news came to Lisbon
at the same time from General Thomieres,
from the agents of the police, by private letters,
and by public report; and if Junot could have
doubted the accuracy of his dispatches, all doubt

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 172.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

would have been removed by the altered appearance
of the Lisbonians, who now knew that of a
truth their deliverance was at hand.</p>

<p>Loison was immediately recalled from Alem-Tejo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and Laborde, who was supposed to be the
ablest of the French generals, was sent with the
two brigades of Generals Brenier and Thomieres
to manœuvre and delay the enemy till Loison

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

could arrive, Travot being appointed to the command
at Lisbon in Laborde’s stead; ... this general

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 175.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was chosen because having demeaned himself
as a man of honour and humanity, he had
deserved and obtained the respect and good opinion
of the Portugueze. The castle at Lisbon,
which had now been strongly fortified, was supplied
with more ammunition and stores. The
fowling-pieces and other weapons, which had
been delivered up in obedience to a former edict,
were broken, or rendered useless, ... the bars of
silver into which the church plate had been cast,
and the other portable plunder, packed for removal,
and deposited on board one of the Portugueze
ships of war. Whole piles of rich hangings
and vestments, the spoils of palaces and
churches, were burnt in a building erected for
the purpose near head-quarters, and in the sight
of the people, for the sake of the gold and silver
wherewith they were embroidered. In order to
counteract the excitement of hope in the citizens,
it was confidently asserted, that 20,000
French had entered Portugal on the side of Braganza;
and for the chance, vain as it was, of
provoking their bigotry, they were reproached
as having brought a stain upon their country by
inviting heretics and Mahometans to fight against
the French, who, like themselves, professed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
true religion. It was indeed actually believed
by the Portugueze that the British had brought
with them a Moorish force: the Portugueze
Consul in Barbary had in fact obtained from the
Emperor of Morocco a promise of 200,000 <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cruzados</i>
for the service of Portugal; and this may
have given occasion to a belief which was confirmed
by the appearance of the Highlanders: ...

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 402.
<br />
Neves, v. 65, 118.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

their dress was immediately pronounced not to
be Christian, and for a time no doubt was entertained
but that these were the Moorish auxiliaries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements of Laborde and Loison.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French apprehended that Sir Arthur
would move upon the Zezere and the Tagus,
for the purpose of interposing between Loison’s
detachment and their main force. Laborde therefore
proceeded by Villa Franca and Rio-Maior
to Candieiros, where he encamped; from Rio-Maior
he might either take the direction of Alcobaça,
Leiria, or Thomar, and, it was hoped,
co-operate with Loison, in case any attempt were
made to prevent their junction. Learning, however,
that the British army kept the line of the
coast, and that Loison had crossed the Tagus
without opposition, and was in no danger of being
impeded in his march, he proceeded to Alcobaça,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 175.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

where he found Thomieres. Junot had
instructed him to reconnoitre the position of
Batalha; ... the last ground, it might have been
thought, on which an invader would have risked
a battle; for there it was where Portugal, (and
then also with English aid,) had achieved her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
own deliverance in the battle of Aljubarrota, one
of the most signal and important victories in the
age of chivalry. The country was too open for
his force, and he therefore remained at Alcobaça,
watching the movements of the enemy,
and hoping to be joined by Loison. That general,
meantime, had suffered much on his march
through Alem-Tejo, from the excessive heat and
the want of water. Though there were none to
oppose them in the field or harass them, the
French felt what it was to be in a country where
every inhabitant regarded them with a deadly
hatred. Wherever they went the towns and villages
were deserted; ... meat, wine, and even
bread, were wanting; and the persons who fell
into their hands, or perhaps remained in their
line for the purpose of deceiving them, sent them
out of their way in search of springs or rivulets,
which when they reached them were dry; ... or

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 172.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of stagnant waters, wherein hemp was steeped,
and of which, nauseous and noisome as it was,
the men could not be prevented from drinking
greedily. Many died of heat and exhaustion on
the way; and they who from fatigue or sickness
fell behind, were killed by the peasantry.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>G. Freire separates from the English.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Loison reached Abrantes on the 9th, crossing
the Tagus by the bridge of boats at that city.
He rested there one day, and, leaving 200 men
in garrison, proceeded on the next across the
Zezere to Thomar, where he arrived on the
same day that the main body of the English
reached Leiria, the two cities being about thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
miles from each other. Laborde was at Alcobaça,
six leagues from the latter city, on the
road to Lisbon. Their object had been to join
at Leiria, but in this the British army had anticipated
them; and as there was no practicable
road for carriages between Thomar and Alcobaça,
Loison could only effect a junction with
Laborde by a circuitous route to the southward,
and thus the latter general was exposed to be
attacked alone. Bernardim de Freire, the Portugueze
commander, in his former conferences
with Sir Arthur, had expressed a wish that the
British commissariat would supply his troops
with British stores during the campaign. The
impossibility of complying with so unreasonable
a demand was pointed out; and Sir Arthur observed,
that it was a new thing to require any
army landing from its ships to supply not only
its own consumption of meal, but also that of
the native army which it was come to assist. He
added, however, that he did not expect to have
occasion to call upon the country for bread during
his march towards Lisbon; but that beef, wine,
and forage would be required, all of which the
Bishop of Porto had engaged should be supplied.
Notwithstanding this explanation, General
Freire renewed the subject on his arrival
at Leiria; and, instead of pursuing his march,
the following morning, at the hour appointed,
he sent a message to the British commander,
saying, that unless the Portugueze were to be
fed by the English commissariat, he would separate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
them from the English army, and march for
Santarem by way of Thomar; urging as his reason,
that supplies would be scarce on the straight
road, but here there was great plenty, and he
should also be in a situation to cut off the retreat
of the French from Lisbon. Freire had
voluntarily placed himself and his troops under
Sir Arthur’s command only the day preceding.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Motives for his separation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There was another reason for this conduct,
which he did not communicate to the British
General. A fear had come upon the Portugueze
officers during the night, that Loison,
whose arrival at Abrantes they knew, would
turn upon the northern provinces; the fate of
Beja and Evora was before their eyes, and they
trembled for Coimbra. Their apprehensions were
confirmed by the arrival that night of dispatches
from the Governor of Coimbra, communicating
to General Freire, as information of the utmost
importance, that Laborde’s orders were to amuse
the Portugueze army, in order that Loison might
pass in their rear and destroy that city; thus, the
Governor added, it had been determined in a
council of war at Lisbon, and the advice was
sent to him by a person upon whom he had
entire reliance. It is very possible that the advice
came from the French themselves, for the
purpose of deceiving him. General Freire began
now to fear not only for his own retreat, but
even that the English, if they met with a repulse,
would be cut off from the Mondego, and unable
to retire to their ships. The truth is, that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
was unequal to his situation, and having persons
about him of as little experience as himself,
they confused one another. Concealing from
Sir Arthur this, which was the real cause of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, v. 79–81.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

his vacillation, he chose to separate upon the
question of supplies. The danger of the plan
was pointed out to him, but in vain: Sir Arthur
urged him, equally in vain, to co-operate with
the British army in the deliverance of Portugal,
if he had any regard to his own honour, to the
honour of his country, or of his Prince: he then
requested him to send him 1000 infantry, with
his cavalry, 250 in number, and his 400 light
troops, engaging to feed them; and this was
done. He advised him, at all events, to remain
at Leiria, or Alcobaça, or any where in the rear
of the English, that his troops might not be unnecessarily
exposed to destruction; but notwithstanding
he was now assured that the English
General had found resources in the country fully
adequate to their subsistence, he said he should
persist in his plan. Sir Arthur, considering it of
importance, on political grounds, that the Portugueze
troops should accompany his march, would
have undertaken to feed them, if he could have
relied upon his commissariat; but this, he complained,
was so ill<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>composed, as to be incapable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
of distributing, even to the British troops,
the ample supplies which had been procured
for them. Freire’s conduct was imputed to an
opinion that the English were too weak for the
service upon which they were advancing; it was
not suspected that he had received intelligence
which alarmed him, and which he had withheld
from the British commander. He was, however,
wise enough to follow the advice which he had
at first refused, and remained at Leiria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Skirmish near Caldas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 14th, Sir Arthur reached Alcobaça,
from which the French fell back the preceding
night: the next day he arrived at Caldas. Laborde
and Thomieres were now at Roliça, about
ten miles off, and their advanced posts were
within a league of the Caldas. Four companies
of riflemen were ordered to drive them back;
they were tempted to an incautious pursuit; a
superior body of the enemy endeavoured to
cut them off, and would have succeeded, had
not General Spencer come to their support. A
trifling loss was sustained in this affair, but the
village was won, and the French retired entirely
from the neighbourhood; their picquets having
been driven from Obidos.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Laborde takes a position at Roliça.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The country between the Caldas and Obidos
is a sandy level, with an open pine wood. Obidos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
itself stands finely upon an insulated hill, and
a little beyond a mountainous or hilly region
begins, the ascent from the low country being
abrupt and difficult. Laborde had retired thither,
knowing the strength of the ground, and expecting
to be joined there by Loison, who, he
knew, would make every exertion to effect his
junction in time. That junction had once already
been prevented by the timely arrival of the British
at Leiria, and Sir Arthur now advanced for the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

purpose of a second time preventing it. The
enemy were drawn up at the foot of the hill, in
front of their position; they retired to the heights,
and Sir Arthur, having reconnoitred the ground,
and seen how difficult the attack in front would
be, determined to attack both flanks. He therefore
directed Major-General Ferguson, with 3000
men, to turn the enemy’s right, and Major-General
Hill to attack the left, while the Portugueze
troops, under Colonel Trant, by a wider
movement on that side, were to penetrate to his
rear. Meanwhile columns under Major-Generals
Crawford, Nightingale, and Fane, were to assemble
in the plain, ready to force their way up
the passes as soon as it should be seen that the
enemy were shaken. This plan, which would
have ensured success with the least possible loss,
was frustrated by some mistake in the delivery
of an order. Ferguson’s brigade was, in consequence
of this error, brought into the plain to
support the central movement; and the attack
was made in front, upon the strength of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
position, before the enemy apprehended any
danger on the flanks or in the rear, and consequently
while they were able to apply their whole
force and undivided attention where they were
strongest.</p>

<p>Roliça was at that time a large and beautiful
village, with more appearance of comfort and
welfare about it than was usual in Portugueze
villages. The place, with its five dependent
hamlets, contained about three hundred families,
the larger half of the population being in Roliça
itself. Most of the houses had an inclosed garden
or orchard, and the country is full of olive
grounds, vineyards, and gardens, with stone inclosures.
A little beyond Roliça is the hamlet
of N. Senhora de Misericordia, a place of fewer
houses, but of the same description: just without
this village the British artillery was well placed,
on a rising ground, where there stood some of
those strong and well-built windmills which are
common in Portugal; below were olive grounds,
and an open grove of ilex or cork, under cover
of which our troops were enabled to approach
and deploy with little loss, though the French
kept up a constant fire from the heights. Laborde
had planted his eagle on the highest point
of Monte S. Anna, near a wooden cross, which
marked the spot of some murder or accidental
death. The view from those heights is singularly
beautiful, presenting just such objects as Gaspar
Poussin delighted in painting, and in such combination
as he would have placed them; rocks and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
hills rising in the valley, open groves, churches
with their old galilees, and houses with all the
picturesque varandas and porticos which bespeak
a genial climate; Obidos with its walls and towers
upon an eminence in middle distance, and its
aqueduct stretching across the country as far as
the eye could follow it; Monte Junto far to the
east, and on the west the Atlantic. And till the
iniquitous invasion of the country by France,
there had been something in the condition of
the people here which accorded with the loveliness
of the scene wherein they were placed.
Such as their lot was, they were contented with
it; three and even four generations were found
under the same roof: like plants, they grew, and
seeded, and decayed, and returned to earth upon
the spot where they had sprung up. If this state
of things be not favourable to commercial prosperity
and the wealth of nations, it is far more
conducive to individual virtue and happiness
than the stage by which it is succeeded.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Roliça.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Upon this beautiful ground it was that the
British troops were first to be tried against the
soldiers of Buonaparte in the Peninsula. The
strength of the enemy’s position fully compensated
for their inferiority in numbers. The
way by which the assailants had to ascend was
up ravines, rather than paths, more practicable
for goats than men, so steep, that in many parts
a slip of the foot would have been fatal, in some
parts overgrown with briars, and in others impeded
by fragments of rock. Three of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
dry water-courses, which appeared the least difficult,
were attempted; that in the centre was
the most promising, and this the 9th and 29th
regiments attacked. They were protected in
their advance by the fire of our artillery. The
way would not admit more than three or four
men abreast, in no place more than six. Near
the top there was a small opening, in the form
of a wedge, overgrown at the point with a thick
coppice of myrtle, arbutus, arborescent heath,
and those other shrubs which in this part of
Portugal render the wild country so beautiful.
An ambush of riflemen had been posted here,
and here Colonel Lake, of the 29th, fell, with
many of his men. When they had reached the
summit, they were exposed to a fire from the
vineyards, while they could not form a front to
return it. The grenadier company, by a brave
charge upon that part of the enemy who were
in the open ground, won for them time to form;
and though Laborde, with great promptitude,
rallied the French as soon as they gave way, and
brought them thrice to the charge, they kept
their ground. This severe contention had continued
two hours, when Brigadier-General Fane,
with the light troops, appeared on the right, and
Major-General Hill on the left. Laborde then
deemed it necessary to abandon his first line and
retire into the hamlet of Azambugeira, which
was in the rear. Throughout the action this
General had shown that the high military reputation
which he enjoyed was well founded;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
all his movements were judiciously planned, and
rapidly and well executed, men and officers giving
good proof of skill and courage. The superiority
of the British troops was therefore finely shown;
for, from the nature of the ground, and from
unavoidable circumstances, the force which on
our side was actually engaged was by no means
equal to that of the enemy. A gallant charge,
under Major-General Spencer, drove them from
this last position in the hamlet; the advantage
could not be followed up for want of cavalry,
and also because of the difficulty of bringing up
cannon and more troops in time. Laborde therefore,
making his last stand upon a height beyond
Azambugeira, collected his troops on the plain
ground behind, formed them into lines, and then
retired toward Torres Vedras, leaving his guns
upon the field.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Abrantes occupied by the Portugueze.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The loss of the British, in killed, wounded,
and missing, was nearly 500. The French<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> acknowledge
to have lost nearly 600. Laborde<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
was slightly wounded at the beginning of the
action. Even during the action he was in hopes
that Loison might arrive; but Loison, finding
that the English were before him at Leiria, found
it necessary to take the line of Torres Novas and
Santarem, and so for Torres Vedras. The Portugueze
had anxiously watched his movements,
and no sooner was it ascertained that he had left
Thomar, than they prepared to cut off the small
garrison which he had left in Abrantes. Freire
had ordered Bacellar to get possession of that
city, with the aid of some Spanish troops under
the Marques de Valadares, who had arrived at
Castello Branco. Captain Manoel de Castro
Correa de Lacerda had been sent forward to
obtain certain intelligence of the enemy; and
he finding circumstances favourable, and adventurers
enough to join him, determined, with
three priests militant, by name Captain-Father
P. Manoel Domingos Crespo, Lieutenant-Father
Lourenço Pires, and Ensign-Father José Nicolao
Beja, to make the attempt without waiting for
the Spaniards. They collected at Villa de Rei
some three hundred men, armed with hunting-spears,
and a few with firelocks; a considerable
number of the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Ordenanças</i> joined them during
the night on the heights of Abrançalha, which
was the place appointed for their meeting; and
early on the morning of that day on which the
battle of Roliça was fought, they entered Abrantes,
leaving Ensign-Father Beja with a party of spearmen
in ambush to cut off the enemy if they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
should attempt to fly. The French, upon the
first appearance of danger, retired into the old
castle, and fired from the windows, ... for there
was no artillery there. Upon this Father Crespo
stationed some sharp-shooters upon the roof of
S. Vicente’s church, which was opposite. The
enemy, then knowing how impossible it was to
hold out in their unprovided state, resolved to
sally, and make for the river side, where they
had four vessels laden with stores, about to fall
down the stream for Lisbon; but before they
could reach the shore, they were surrounded by
such numbers, and lost so many men, that they
laid down their arms. They who were on board
the vessels, seeing their danger, leaped into the
river; some perished in attempting to cross it,
they who reached the opposite shore were pursued
and hunted down like wild beasts; fifty-two
were killed that day, and 117 taken prisoners;
the few who escaped for the time had no place
of safety near, and fell into the hands of the
peasantry. The Corregedor-Mor at this time
met with a miserable fate. Because of the office
which he unfortunately held, the French had
made him the instrument of their exactions: the
same constitutional timidity which prevented
him from resigning his post rather than obey
their tyrannical orders, induced him now to fly,
in the unworthy hope of securing himself under
their protection. He therefore forded the river,
and hid himself in a vineyard; there a peasant
discovered him, to whom he immediately offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
200 milreis if he would conduct him to the
French army; the villain took the money, led
him to a solitary place, stabbed him in five places,
then robbed him, and left him to expire. On
the third day he was found by some women,
still alive, and was carried to Abrantes; no care
availed to save his life, and he died rather of
inanition and loss of blood, than from the nature

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, v. 95–105.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of his wounds; but he was able to relate what
had passed, so that the murderer was apprehended
and brought to justice.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements in Alem-Tejo and Algarve.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Among the French effects which were taken
at Abrantes were about 200 hides and 1000 bags
of cotton, which the state of the intermediate
country had prevented them from sending into
France: they had carried on a gainful trade while
the communication was open. But now they
began to feel that the amount of their gains and
of their plunder was in danger. In spite of all
prohibitions and precautions, some intelligence
still found its way to Lisbon. The British squadron
and the transports had been seen from the
heights, and though the French abated nothing
of their high tone, the inhabitants were now well
assured that their deliverance was at hand. As
the only course which offered any hope of extricating
himself, Junot resolved to collect the
whole of his disposable force, and give the English
battle before their reinforcements arrived,
and before they should be ready to act on the
offensive. The only places in which he left
garrisons were Elvas, Almeida, and Peniche.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
Setubal had hitherto been occupied by a force
under General Graindorge, who had succeeded
Kellermann in the command there. His situation
had not been tranquil, while Mestre had
taken possession of Alcacere do Sal, and an English
frigate was off the port. But Mestre was
recalled in all haste to Beja, when that city, after
the fate of Evora, apprehended a second visitation
with fire and sword. The men whom he
commanded gave on this occasion proof of that
patient and uncomplaining spirit with which the
Spaniards and Portugueze endure privations.
They started fasting and without provisions, and
after a long day’s march reached the little town
of Odivella, where no rations had been provided
for them. Mestre and his adjutant then went
from door to door, to beg bread, and with the
bread which was thus obtained they were contented
and cheerful. Aware of the alarm which
Loison’s operations had excited, Graindorge resolved
to clear the neighbourhood, and the Juntas
of Alcacere, Santiago de Cacem, and Grandola,
fled at his approach. But when Beja was relieved
from danger by Loison’s movements to the north,
Mestre, who had been dispatched toward Evora,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Alcacere do Sal and Setubal abandoned by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was ordered to return upon Alcacere, and the
same direction was taken by one body of men from
Algarve, and by another under Lopes from Beja.
Graindorge had now received orders to retire
with his troops to Almada; Alcacere therefore was
abandoned when the Portugueze arrived there,
and Setubal also. Setubal had been singularly fortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
during a time of general rapacity. Perfect
order had been maintained there while Solano
and the Spaniards possessed it; and when Graindorge
succeeded Kellermann, a Portugueze woman,
who lived with him as his mistress, had
influence enough to prevent him from delivering
up that beautiful town to pillage, which his men
required, and which, it is said, they had been

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Neves, iv. 173–179.
<br />
Observador Portuguez, 291.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

promised. The Portugueze writers ought not
to have passed over in silence the name of one
who averted so much evil, and who, it may well
be believed, was more to be pitied than condemned
for her frailty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures at Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>About 300 men were left at Palmella. Graindorge
had two regiments under his command at
Almada and other places on the left bank of the
Tagus. The forts at the Bugio, Trafaria, and
St. Julien, were occupied by the French, and
they had troops also at Cascaes and Ericeyra.
Sufficient force was to be left in and near Lisbon,
to keep down the inhabitants, by the presumed
aid of the Russian squadron, whose presence in
the river was of great importance to Junot at
this time. The enemy had recourse also to their
usual policy of circulating fabricated intelligence.
They affirmed, that 20,000 French had arrived
at Braganza, and they produced Badajoz Gazettes
which must have been forged for the purpose,
relating the defeat and consternation of the Spaniards,
and the rejoicings with which Joseph had
been received on his triumphant entrance into
Madrid. Few persons were deceived by these
artifices. On the 15th the Emperor Napoleon’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
birthday was celebrated; the guns from the ships
and fortresses were fired, Junot gave a grand
entertainment to his officers, and appeared afterwards
at the Opera in state; but meantime every
thing was made ready for his departure. The
night was passed in giving orders, and at daybreak
the reserve was in motion, with the staff,
the military chest, containing a million francs,
and the most precious and portable part of their
plunder. The Comte de Bourmont, and some
other French emigrant officers who had found an
asylum in Lisbon during the horrors of the Revolution,
on this occasion joined the French
army, the Count at his own solicitation being
placed upon the staff, to fight against a government
by whose bounty they had been supported,
and a people who had hospitably received them
in their distress: and for this moral treason

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 406.<br />Thiebault, 187–8.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

they have been extolled in their own country,
with that perversion of principle and utter insensibility
to honour, which equally characterise
the schools of the Revolution, and of Buonaparte.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Proclamation to the people of Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It had been proposed to form a national guard
at Lisbon at this time, composed of all who had
any property to protect; but this was rejected,
less as being impracticable than as dangerous.
The Lisbonians had too much reason to execrate
their oppressors. Their sufferings, though not
of that kind which give a splendour to history,
and consecrate the memory of the sufferers, had
been more pitiable, for they had been long continued
and obscure. The French themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
confessed, that they knew not how the people
of Lisbon subsisted during the three months
preceding the harvest;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 95.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

for it was known that
the consumption of food in that great city was
only one-third of what it used to be, and the
numbers who had been expelled, who had emigrated
with the court, or had found means of
following it, were not greater than that of the
foreign troops who had been introduced. Impossible
as it was to conciliate a people upon
whom they had inflicted such deep and irreparable
injuries, the French deemed it politic at this time
to take the most conciliatory measures in their
power; if the popular feeling could be repressed
or allayed only for a few days, by that time they
should either have obtained a victory over the
English, or have placed themselves by treaty
under the safeguard of British honour. With
these views Junot left a decree, that the heads
of the tribunals, and the chief persons among
the nobility and clergy, should be invited to
assist at the council of government during his
absence. He left also a proclamation to the inhabitants
of Lisbon, saying, that he was departing
from them for three or four days, to give battle
to the English, and whatever might be the event,
he should return. “I leave,” said he, “to govern
Lisbon, a general who, by the mildness and firmness
of his character, has obtained the friendship
of the Portugueze at Cascaes and Oeyras; General
Travot will, by these same virtues, obtain
that of the inhabitants of Lisbon. Hitherto you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
have been tranquil; it is your interest to continue
so! do not stain yourselves with a horrible
crime at the moment when, without any danger
of your own, the lot of arms is about to determine
by what power you are to be governed.
Reflect for an instant upon the interests of the
three nations who are contending for the possession
of Lisbon. What the French desire is the
glory and the prosperity of the city and of the
kingdom, for this is the interest and the policy
of France. Spain wishes to invade Portugal and
reduce it to a province, that she may again make
herself mistress of the Peninsula. And England
would domineer over you for the purpose of destroying
your port and your navy, and impeding
the progress of industry among you. The English
regard the magnificence of your port with envy;
they will not suffer it to exist so near them, and
they have no hope of preserving it. They know
that a new French army has already passed your
frontiers, and that if this should not be sufficient,
another will come after it; but they will have
destroyed your naval establishments, they will
have caused the destruction of Lisbon, and this
is what they aim at, and what they desire: they
know that they cannot maintain themselves upon
the Continent; but if they can destroy the ports
and the navy of any other power, they are content.
I depart full of confidence in you. I reckon
upon all the citizens who are interested in the
preservation of public order; and I am persuaded
that it will be preserved. Call to mind the miseries<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
which must necessarily follow, if this beautiful
city should compel my troops to enter it by force!
The exasperated soldiers would not be then to be
controlled; ... fire, sword, all the horrors of war
which are practised in a city taken by assault, ...
pillage, ... death, ... behold what you would draw

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 408.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

upon yourselves! The thought alone makes me
shudder. Inhabitants of Lisbon, avert from yourselves
these terrible calamities!”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations on board the Russian squadron.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The tone of the French was somewhat altered
in their menaces. There had been no shuddering
when the fate of Beja and Evora was announced
to the people of Lisbon, nor when the
massacre at Leiria was perpetrated. Care was
taken to manifest that the French were prepared
to execute their threats if needful. The Russian
squadron, which lay at anchor in a line from
Junqueira to Boa Vista, was made ready for
action, the men being stationed at their quarters
with lighted matches; they, no doubt, apprehended
an attack from the English fleet, but

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 410.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

La Garde intimated that they would fire upon
the city in case an insurrection were attempted.
Justly apprehensive, however, for his personal
safety, this Intendant, whom, because perhaps
of his office, the people regarded with peculiar
hatred, went sometimes to pass the night on
board the Vasco da Gama, and General Travot,
though he was evidently esteemed by the people
for his mild and honourable conduct (so much
is a good name worth even in the worst times)
thought it prudent not to sleep out of the Castle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junction of Loison, Laborde, and Junot.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Junot went by water to Villa Franca, and
leaving Thiebault there to command the reserve,
joined Loison at Alcoentre. That General had
reached Santarem on the 13th, in a deplorable
condition. The weather was intensely hot, without
a cloud in the sky, or a breath of air stirring.
Whole companies lay down upon the way; many
died of thirst, and more would have perished if
the officers of the staff, as soon as they arrived at
that city, had not gone out with a great number
of the inhabitants carrying water to meet them;
brandy also was sent out, and carts to convey
those who were unable to proceed farther on
foot. Each of Loison’s long marches at this
time is said to have cost him not less than an
hundred men. The troops were so dreadfully
exhausted, that he was compelled to remain two
days at Santarem. On the 16th he proceeded
to Alcoentre, where Junot joined him the next
day; they then moved to Cercal, and on the day
after the action at Roliça the British army distinctly

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Early Campaigns, 18.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

saw their columns in the line of Torres
Vedras. To that place Laborde was now recalled,
who had retreated beyond it to Montachique;
he effected his junction on the 19th, and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 190–193.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

when General Thiebault arrived with the reserve
on the 20th, the whole force which Junot could
bring into the field was collected there, in number
about 12,000 infantry, and 1200 or 1500 horse.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The British advance to Vimeiro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir Arthur had not pursued Laborde after the
battle of Roliça; the line by which the enemy

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">August 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

retired would have led him from the sea. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
was beginning his march for Torres Vedras on
the morrow, when he received advice that General
Anstruther was arrived on the coast. His
original intention had been to employ this General’s
brigade, and that of General Acland, in
besieging Peniche, if that should be necessary;
otherwise to land them in some of the bays near
the rock, in the rear of the enemy, while he
pressed upon their front. But the resistance
which he had experienced at Roliça, and his
disappointment of any co-operation from Freire,
induced him now to land General Anstruther’s
troops, and join them to the army. He proceeded
therefore to the village of Vimeiro, that
being the position best calculated to effect his
junction, and, at the same time, a march in advance.
Calms prevented the fleet, which was
anchored off the Berlings, from standing in, till
the evening of the 19th. The brigade was then
landed at Maceira, upon a sandy beach, at the
foot of a cliff almost perpendicular, the ascent
of which is exceedingly steep and difficult. The
landing was a measure of extreme difficulty and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Anstruther’s brigade lands.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

hazard. The boats were almost always filled in
going-in by the surf, many were swamped, and
a few men perished; the disembarkation, however,
by the great exertions and skill of the navy,
was effected with less loss than might have been
expected. The French could not oppose the landing,
but, profiting by their superiority in cavalry,
they sent a body of dragoons, in the hope of attacking
the brigade on its march. Against this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
danger due precautions had been taken. The
troops, when they had marched about three
leagues, found a detachment under General
Spencer waiting at Lourinham to receive them,
and took their place in the advanced guard.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrival of Sir Harry Burrard in the roads.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French cavalry were active during this and
the preceding day; they scoured the country, and
Sir Arthur could obtain no information of the
enemy, except that their position was very strong,
and occupied by their whole force. On the 20th,
at noon, it was announced that General Acland
was in the offing; and on the evening of the same
day Sir Harry Burrard, the second in command,
arrived in Maceira Roads. Sir Arthur immediately
went on board, informed him of what had
been done, and of the present state of things, and
laid before him the plan of operations upon which
he had intended to proceed. His purpose was
to march on the following morning, push his advanced
guard to Mafra, and halt the main body
about four or five miles from that place, thus
turning the enemy’s position at Torres Vedras.
He possessed as much knowledge of the ground
as good maps and scientific descriptions could
impart; Sir Charles Stuart (a man whose great
military talents had never been allowed a field
whereon to display themselves) had carefully
surveyed this part of the country when he commanded
the British troops in Portugal; it had
not escaped him, that upon this ground, in case
of serious invasion, the kingdom must be saved
or lost; and his maps and papers were in Sir<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
Arthur’s hands. The battle would thus be fought
in a country of which he had adequate knowledge,
and he hoped to enter Lisbon with the
retreating or flying enemy. Such was the plan
which he had formed, and orders for marching
on the morrow had actually been issued, before
Sir Harry’s arrival.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He alters the plan of the campaign.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>To Sir Arthur, who had a well-founded confidence
in himself and in his troops, no prospect
could have been more encouraging; but the new
commander did not behold it hopefully. The
objections to a forward movement preponderated
in his mind; he learnt that the artillery<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> horses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
were inefficient, that our men, for want of cavalry,
were kept close to their encampments by the
enemy’s horse; and that it would not be possible
to go far into the country, because they depended
upon the ships for bread. Weighing these things,
he was not convinced that Sir Arthur’s intentions
were expedient; the decision which he was now
to make appeared to him most serious in its consequences;
he thought it was impossible to calculate
the disasters to which a check might
expose the army, and therefore he deemed it
necessary to wait for Sir John Moore’s division.
Sir Arthur had recommended that that division,
when it arrived in the Mondego, should march
upon Santarem, a position from whence it might
intercept the enemy’s retreat, whether they attempted
to make their way to Almeida or to
Elvas; but the new commander hearing on his
way of the action at Roliça, and disapproving
this arrangement, had immediately dispatched
instructions by which Sir John Moore was directed
to proceed from the Mondego, and join
him as speedily as possible in Maceira Roads.
In vain did Sir Arthur represent the precious
time that would be lost before this division could
be landed and become serviceable at Vimeiro;
the far greater utility which might be expected
from its presence at Santarem; the evil of at once
changing their operations from an offensive to a
defensive course; and of allowing the enemy to
choose their time and ground. For, situated as
the two armies now were, it was impossible to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
avoid an action. If the British troops advanced,
they would have the advantage of acting on the
offensive; it was his opinion that they might
reach Mafra before the French could bring on
a general engagement; and in that case they
should turn the French position. But these representations
were unavailing; an inauspicious
spirit of caution prevailed. The whole plan of
the campaign was changed; and with the enemy
collected within three leagues, the army was
ordered to remain stationary, till a corps should
arrive, of which no tidings had yet been received.
In a general who commands good troops the want
of confidence is as great a fault as the excess of
it in the commander of an ill-disciplined army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The battle of Vimeiro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was soon seen how well Sir Arthur had
judged of the enemy’s intentions. Junot was ill
supplied with provisions; he could not venture
long to be absent from Lisbon: situated as he
was, it appeared to him that there would be less
evil in an immediate defeat, than must arise from
prolonged operations, though they should lead

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 194.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to a victory. His business, therefore, was to
bring on an action as soon as possible, and to
make the attack; and at the moment when Sir
Harry Burrard, resolving upon delay, had countermanded
the orders for advancing on the morrow,
the French were in motion.</p>

<p>Vimeiro, a name which was now to become
memorable in British and Portugueze history,
is a village situated nearly at the bottom of a
lovely valley, about three miles from the sea, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
screened from the sea breeze by mountainous
heights, through which the little river Maceira
winds its way. The village stands at the eastern
extremity of these heights; and on the opposite
side, separated from them by a deep ravine, are
other heights, over which the road to Lourinham
passes, a little town in the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Termo</i> or district of
which the parishes of Vimeiro and Maceira are
included. The western termination reaches the
sea-shore. As the army had halted here only
for the night, meaning to proceed early on the
morrow, they were disposed of, not as expecting
an attack, but as most convenient for the troops.
Six brigades bivouacked on the height to the
westward. The advanced guard was posted on
a hill south-east of Vimeiro, to cover the commissariat
and stores which were in the village:
this height was entirely commanded by higher
ground to the westward. The cavalry and the
reserve of artillery were in the valley, between
the hills on which the infantry were placed; and
there were picquets of observation on the hills
to the eastward.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 21.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The enemy, who had marched all night, and
whom some accidents had impeded on their way,
first appeared at eight in the morning, forming
in strong bodies upon the heights toward Lourinham,
thus threatening the advanced guard and
the left, which was the weak part of the British
position. Sir Arthur had visited the advanced
posts early in the day, and had returned to his
quarters before the first shots were exchanged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
with the enemy’s advance. He now moved
the brigades of Generals Ferguson, Nightingale,
Acland, and Bowes, successively across the ravine
to the heights on the Lourinham road.
General Anstruther’s brigade took post on the
right of the advanced guard, and Major-General
Hill was moved nearer, as a support to these
troops, and as a reserve, in addition to which
our small cavalry force was in the rear of their
right. The French army was in two divisions, ...
the right, of about 6000 men, under General
Loison; the left, about 5000, under Laborde.
Kellermann had the reserve, which was intended
to connect the two wings, but they were too
distant from each other. General Margaron
commanded the cavalry.</p>

<p>Laborde came along the valley to attack the
advanced guard on the eminence or table hill;
he had a column of infantry and cavalry to cover
his left flank, and on his right one regiment
marched in column to turn the defenders, and
penetrate the village by the church; but this
purpose had been foreseen, and part of the 43rd
had been ordered into the churchyard to prevent
it. The French advanced with perfect steadiness,
though exposed to a severe fire of riflemen
posted behind the trees and banks, and of seven
pieces of artillery well directed. They advanced
like men accustomed to action and to victory;
but suffering more severely as they drew nearer,
and especially from the Shrapnell shells, (then
first brought into use,) they faltered, and opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
a confused fire. Still they advanced, and arrived
within a few paces of the brow of the hill, where
the 50th regiment, under Colonel Walker, with
a single company of the rifle corps on its left,
stood opposed to them. That regiment poured
upon them a destructive volley, and instantly
charged with the bayonet, and penetrated the
angle of the column, which then broke and
turned. The regiment which was entering the
village by the church, was attacked in flank by
General Acland’s brigade, then advancing to its
position on the heights; and our cavalry, poor
in number as it was, charged with effect. The
discomfiture of this column was then complete;
they fled, leaving about 1000 men on the ground,
350 prisoners, and seven pieces of artillery; and
they were pursued for nearly two miles to the
plain beyond the woody ground, where they
were supported by a reserve of horse, and where
Lieutenant-Colonel Taylor, of the 20th light dragoons,
who particularly distinguished himself that
day, fell, with many of his men, overpowered by
a much superior force of cavalry. The secondary
column, under General Brenier, which was
to have supported Laborde in his attack, made a
side movement to the left, in order to cross the
ravine, and thus it was separately engaged by
General Anstruther’s brigade; and being charged
with the bayonet, was repulsed with great loss.
An aide-de-camp of Sir Arthur’s coming up to
tell this General that a corps should be sent to
his assistance, he replied, “Sir, I am not pressed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
and I want no assistance; I am beating the
French, and am able to beat them wherever I
find them.”</p>

<p>Loison’s attack was made nearly at the same
time as Laborde’s: it was supported by a large
body of cavalry, and made with the characteristic
and imposing impetuosity of French troops.
They drove in our light troops, but they were
checked by General Ferguson’s brigade, consisting
of the 36th, 40th, and 71st, which formed
the first line; after some close and heavy firing
of musketry, the 82d and 29th came up, and the
brigades of Generals Bowes and Acland. The
enemy were then charged with the bayonet; this
weapon is of French invention, but it was made
for British hands. They came to the charge
bravely, and stood it for a moment; ... in that
moment their foremost rank fell “like a line
of grass before the mowers.” This is not the
flourish of an historian, seeking artfully to embellish
details which no art can render interesting
to any but military readers; it is the language
of an actor in the scene, who could not call it to
mind in after-hours without shuddering; for the
very men whose superiority was thus decidedly
proved, could not speak without involuntary awe,
of so complete and instantaneous a destruction,
produced as it was, not by artillery or explosions,
but by their own act and deed, and the strength
of their own hearts and hands. The bodies of
about 300 French grenadiers were counted upon
the field, who had fallen in this charge. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
enemy were pursued to a considerable distance,
and six pieces of cannon were taken in the pursuit.
General Kellermann made a vigorous attempt,
late in the action, to recover these from
the 71st and 82d, which were halted in a valley
where the guns had been captured. These regiments
retired a little way to some advantageous
ground, then faced about, fired, and advancing
with the bayonet, drove the French back with
great loss. Thus were they every where repulsed,
though their whole force had been engaged,
while not more than half the British army had
been brought into action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir Harry Burrard takes the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the action began Sir Harry Burrard
and his staff left the ship; they soon heard the
firing after they were on shore, and by the time
they reached Vimeiro, which is about three
miles from the landing-place, the armies were
hotly engaged. They found Sir Arthur on the
heights, and he explained in few words to the new
Commander the position of the army, and the
measures which he had taken for beating the
enemy. Sir Harry was perfectly satisfied, and
directed him to go on with an operation which
he had so happily and so well begun. This he
did not as giving up his command for the time,
but as fulfilling one of the functions of a commander,
by directing Sir Arthur to pursue measures
which he approved, and holding himself as
responsible for the event as if the plan had been
originally his own. So far all was well. Toward
the close of the action, when the French were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
beaten on the left, and it was evident that they
must be every where defeated, Sir Arthur went to
him, and represented that this was the moment for
advancing; that he ought to move the right wing
to Torres Vedras, and pursue the beaten enemy
with the left. By this movement upon Torres
Vedras, the French would be cut off from the
nearest road to Lisbon, or if they attempted it,
they would find themselves between two bodies
of our troops; there remained for them, as the
alternative, the circuitous route by Alenquer and
Villa Franca; ... they were dispirited, beaten, and
in confusion, absolutely, in his opinion, incapable
of forming or of appearing again in the shape of
an army, if they were followed even at a slower
rate by a victorious enemy; and this he said,
giving them full credit for discipline and great
facility in forming after having been broken.
There was plenty of ammunition in the camp for
another battle, and provisions for twelve days.
But neither these representations, urged as they
were with natural and fitting warmth, nor the
victory which was before his eyes, could induce
the new Commander to deviate from his former
opinion. He replied, that he saw no reason to
change his purpose, and that the same motives
which induced him yesterday to wait for reinforcements,
had still the same weight. At this
moment the enemy were retiring in great disorder,
and most completely disheartened by their
defeat. Sir Arthur, grieved at seeing the irrecoverable
opportunity go by, made a second attempt<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
to convince the Commander that victory
was in his hands. General Ferguson had sent
his aide-de-camp to represent the great advantage
of advancing, ... he himself could, in fact, have
cut off a considerable body of the enemy. Sir
Arthur took the aide-de-camp to the Commander.
But this second representation was as ineffectual
as the first. His Adjutant-General, Brigadier-General
Clinton, and Colonel Murray, his Quarter-Master-General,
who had coincided in opinion
with him the preceding evening, agreed with
him now also. He had just heard from an officer
who had passed through General Freire’s troops,
such an account of them and their proceedings,
as precluded any hope of rendering them useful;
the artillery horses seemed to him inefficient; but
more especially the want of cavalry, he thought,
incapacitated the army from following up its success.
The 260 Portugueze horse which were
with us had shown themselves nearly useless;
the British were only 210 in number, and they
had suffered severely in the action, ... this was
known, though the extent of their loss had not
yet been ascertained. These difficulties preponderated
with him; he adhered still to his
determination; and Sir Arthur, whose sense of
military duty would not allow him to act in disregard
of orders, as Nelson was accustomed to
do, turned to one of his officers, and concealing
the bitterness of disappointment under a semblance
of levity, said, “Well, then, we have nothing
to do, but to go and shoot red-legged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
partridges,” ... the game with which that country
abounds. From that moment he gave up all
hope of cutting the French off from Lisbon, inclosing
them there, or preventing them, if they
thought proper to attempt it, from protracting
the campaign by retreating upon Elvas and
Almeida.</p>

<p>The loss of the enemy in this action was about
3000<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> killed and wounded, thirteen pieces of
artillery, and twenty-three ammunition waggons;
that of the English little more than 700 killed,
wounded, and missing. The British numbers in
the field were 16,000, of which only half had
been engaged; the French were about 14,000, including
1300 cavalry, and the whole of this force
was brought into action. General Solignac was
severely wounded; General Brenier wounded,
and left on the field. He was in danger of being
put to death by those into whose hands he had
fallen, when a Highlander, by name Mackay,
who was a corporal in the 71st, came up and
rescued him. The French General, in gratitude
for his preservation, offered him his watch and
purse; but Mackay refused to accept them.
When he had delivered his prisoner in safety to
Colonel Pack, the French General could not
help saying, “What sort of man is this? He has
done me the greatest service, and yet refuses to
take the only reward which I can at present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
offer him!” Brenier no doubt contrasted this
with the conduct of his countrymen, in whose
rapacities and cruelties, it appears by the testimony
of the Portugueze, that he had no share;
when, therefore, Colonel Pack replied, “We are
British soldiers, sir, and not plunderers,” he must
have deeply felt the disgrace which had been
brought upon the French character. Mackay
was immediately made a serjeant by Sir Arthur
Wellesley’s express desire; and the Highland
Society, at their next meeting, voted him a gold
medal, with a suitable device and inscription.
The piper to the grenadier company of the same
regiment, Stewart was his name, received early
in the action a dangerous wound in the thigh:
he would not, however, be carried off the field,
but, sitting down<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> where his comrades might
hear him, he continued playing warlike airs till
the end of the engagement. A handsome stand
of Highland pipes, with an inscription commemorating
the manner in which he had deserved
the donation, was voted him by the Highland
Society.</p>

<p>Most of the wounded French who fell into the
conqueror’s hands were young, and of delicate
appearance, ... apparently men whose lot would
not have fallen in the army, under any other
system than that of the conscription, though,
having been forced into it, they had acquired
the worst vices which have ever disgraced and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
degraded the profession of arms. They were
dressed in long white linen coats and trowsers,
their firelocks were about six inches longer in
the barrel than ours, their bayonets about three
shorter, the locks of their pieces much better
finished, and the pans so constructed, that the
powder was not liable to fall out, ... an accident
which at that time often happened to ours. A
chaplain of the British army, as he was endeavouring
to render assistance to some of them,
while under the surgeon’s hands, addressed himself
to one in the language of commiseration,
and uttered, at the same time, a natural expression
of regret at the horrors of war: but the
Frenchman fiercely answered him, with a mixture
of pride and indignation, that he gloried in
his wounds, and that war was the greatest happiness
of life. During the whole day the armed
peasantry prowled about the field, taking vengeance
upon every wounded or straggling Frenchman
whom they could find, for the manifold
wrongs of their country, and the aggravated injuries
which they had endured. So conscious
indeed were the prisoners of the little mercy
which they deserved at their hands, that they
dreaded lest these men should break in upon
them, and massacre them all; and a guard was
stationed to protect them. The peasantry, however,
passed the night in the field, carousing
round a large fire, recounting to each other what
they had done, and rejoicing over the day’s
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French resolve to propose terms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In withholding the army from following up
the great advantage which it had gained, Sir
Harry Burrard knew how unpopular such a determination
must be, and sacrificed his own feelings
to his judgement. He thought it not allowable
to risk much when the reinforcements which
were at hand would make the British force so
superior, that any further efforts of the enemy
must be vain, and success would be obtained
without hazard and with less loss. He erred in
judgement; but this honourable testimony was
borne to him by Sir Arthur Wellesley, the person
of all others by whom that error must have been
felt most keenly, that he decided upon fair military
grounds in the manner which he thought
most conducive to the interests of the country.
The French failed not to profit by the respite
which was thus allowed them; they formed a
rear-guard of four regiments of cavalry, and retired<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
at leisure, no attempt being made to harass
their retreat. Junot, who is said to have exposed
himself at the close of the action so as
hardly to have been saved from the British
cavalry, summoned Generals Laborde, Loison,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
Kellermann, and Thiebault, upon the field, and
demanded their opinions, whether the army ought
again to try the lot of arms, and if not, what
course it should pursue. They agreed that they
were neither in a condition to give battle, nor
to stand one. Their troops were harassed, discontented,
and discouraged; their ammunition
would not last three hours longer; their provisions
were failing, their horses already sinking
for want of forage. Their losses were irreparable,
whereas the enemy were looking for strong
reinforcements; and, in fine, the slightest reverse
would now leave them at the mercy of the English
and Portugueze. Nothing remained but
to preserve the best attitude they could, and
retire to Lisbon, the possession of which was
now their only safeguard. They retreated accordingly
to Torres Vedras. A second council
was held there on the morrow; and upon a full
view of the difficulties and dangers<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> of their
situation, and the impossibility of effecting a retreat
through so large a part of Spain as must be
traversed before they could effect a junction with
their countrymen, they resolved to try what
could be done by negotiation. General Kellermann,
therefore, was dispatched with a flag of
truce to propose a convention for the evacuation
of Portugal. Meantime Sir Hew Dalrymple had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
arrived and taken the command of the British
army, which thus had three commanders-in-chief
within twenty-four hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrival of Sir Hew Dalrymple.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir Hew Dalrymple had been expressly chosen
for this command because of the zeal and judgement
which he had displayed during the whole
of those important transactions in the south of
Spain on which so much depended, and in which
he had acted upon his own responsibility. In
a private letter from Lord Castlereagh, then
minister for the war department, Sir Arthur
Wellesley was recommended to his particular
confidence, and a full persuasion expressed that
that officer’s high reputation would alone dispose
Sir Hew to select him for any service which required
great prudence and temper, combined
with much military experience; but, above all,
that the habits of communication in which Sir
Arthur had for a length of time been with his
majesty’s ministers, concerning the affairs of
Spain, would point him out as an officer of
whom it would be desirable for the commander-in-chief,
on all accounts, to make the most prominent
use which the rules of the service would
permit. Sir Hew embarked at Gibraltar on the
13th; and learnt that night from Lord Collingwood,
who was off Cadiz, that Sir Arthur’s corps
had either landed, or was about to land, in
Mondego Bay. Arriving off the Tagus on the
19th, he was informed by Sir Charles Cotton,
that Sir Arthur was proceeding along the coast.
It was not Sir Hew’s wish to supersede that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
General in a detached command for which he
had been particularly chosen, especially when
he was now completely engaged in an enterprise
from which it was impossible to recede,
and which required all his ability to accomplish.
Under these feelings, therefore, the Commander-in-chief
resolved to proceed to Mondego Bay,
and there join the expected reinforcements when
they should land, leaving Sir Arthur meantime
to pursue and complete his own plan. Seeing,
however, on the way a number of ships under
the land, and receiving a vague account of the
action at Roliça from a sloop of war, he sent an
aide-de-camp on shore for intelligence, ordering
him to inform Sir Arthur, if he chanced to see
him, that he was proceeding to fall in with Sir
Harry Burrard and the main body, and that
though he wished to be informed of his proceedings,
he did not mean to interfere with his
command. This was on the evening of the 21st;
about midnight the boat returned, bringing intelligence
of the battle, and that Sir Harry
Burrard was in command. There was now no
room for that delicacy toward Sir Arthur, as
honourable as it was judicious, which he had
resolved to observe. His determination was immediately
taken, and in the morning the frigate
stood in for the shore.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He orders the army to advance. <span class="date">Aug. 22.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>None of the official accounts which Sir Arthur
had addressed to him had been received; he
landed therefore with no other information than
what had been thus gathered upon the way, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
entirely unacquainted with the actual state of the
French army. When he reached the beach they
were embarking the wounded for Porto; during
the whole night the sailors had been thus employed,
wading nearly up to the middle in the
sea, and displaying as much humanity as skill.
Arriving at Vimeiro, he found the army on the
ground which it had occupied the day before,
the dead lying on the field, and the carts still
busy in removing the wounded. That ground
had not been chosen as a military position, but
merely as a halting-place, and it was now necessary
to remove from it, because of the late
action. Sir Hew therefore gave orders for
marching the next morning at daybreak toward
Lisbon by way of Mafra. Like his predecessor,
he thought that Sir Arthur had entered
upon a hazardous operation, which, unless
it obtained complete success, must end in complete
ruin, the British having no prospect of
support, nor any thing upon which to fall back
in case of disaster, so that on their part the
battle would be fought for existence, while the
enemy, in case of defeat, would lose only what
were killed or taken. But he differed from Sir
Harry Burrard in this, that he deemed it imprudent
to wait for Sir John Moore’s division,
the arrival of which was extremely uncertain,
and that he saw the necessity of pursuing active
measures. The French, he knew, must either
give him battle, for the sake of defending Lisbon,
(a chance which he was willing to take, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
they were superior in cavalry, and, as he thought,
in numbers, and though they would have the
great advantage of choosing their ground;) or
they would cross the Tagus.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Kellermann arrives to propose an armistice.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Soon after mid-day an alarm was given that the
enemy were advancing to renew the attack; the
position was taken as on the preceding morning.
It proved to be a body of cavalry with a flag
of truce; and General Kellermann alighting at
head-quarters, proposed an armistice, for the purpose
of concluding a treaty for the evacuation of
Portugal by the French. Sir Hew immediately
called for his two predecessors. He himself had
no means of knowing, but from them, what the
consequences of yesterday’s battle really had
been; the responsibility was his, but for the information
upon which the agreement was to be
founded, he trusted to them, and more especially
to Sir Arthur. That General’s plans had been
completely defeated by the refusal to follow up
the victory, and by the change which Sir Harry
Burrard, before he landed, had made in the intended
destination of Sir John Moore’s corps.
Considering, therefore, that in consequence of
these errors the enemy had been allowed leisure
to resume a formidable position between the
British army and Lisbon, and could not now
by any increase of the British numbers be prevented
from crossing the Tagus, and occupying
in strength the strong place of Elvas, with its
stronger fort La Lippe, and Almeida; that the
Tagus would not for some time longer be open<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
to the fleet, the army meantime depending upon
the ships for supplies, and that its communication
with them by the coast must at that season be
most precarious: considering also how important
it was that the troops should not be delayed by
regular sieges in Portugal, but march as soon as
possible into Spain, he thought it expedient that
the French should be allowed to evacuate Portugal
with their arms and baggage, and that
every facility for this purpose should be afforded
them. They occupied at that time, in a military
point of view, he thought, the whole of Portugal,
having every strong hold in their hands; their
present situation enabled them still to avail themselves
of those possessions, and to strengthen
them as they might think proper; and he was
of opinion that an army which had its retreat
open, and possessed such advantages, had a fair
claim to be allowed such terms. He wished,
however, to limit the suspension of arms to
eight-and-forty hours. Sir Hew preferred that
it should be unlimited, as it had been proposed;
in this he had a view to the disembarkation of
Sir John Moore’s corps, which was not forbidden
by the agreement.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Terms of the armistice.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>An armistice accordingly for the purpose of
negotiating a definitive convention was concluded
upon<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> these terms: That the river Sisandre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
should be the line of demarcation between
the two armies, and that neither of them
should occupy Torres Vedras; that the English
general should bind himself to comprehend the
armed Portugueze in the truce, and that their
line of demarcation should be from Leiria to
Thomar: that it was agreed that the French
army should in no case be considered as prisoners
of war; that all the individuals of it should be
transported to France with their arms and baggage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
and private property, and that they should
be deprived of no part of it whatsoever: that no
individual, whether Portugueze, Frenchman, or
of a nation allied to France, should be molested
for his political conduct, but be protected, both
in person and property, and have liberty to retire
from Portugal within a limited time, with all his
effects: that the neutrality of the port of Lisbon
should be acknowledged for the Russian fleet;
that is to say, that, when the English army and
fleet should be in possession of the city and port,
the Russian fleet should neither be disturbed
during its stay, nor stopped when it might choose
to depart, nor pursued when it had sailed, till
after the time fixed, in such cases, by maritime
law: that all the French artillery, and all their
cavalry horses, should be transported to France.</p>

<p>A demur was, with good reason, made concerning
the baggage and private property which
the French were to carry off with them; and
Kellermann explained, that the words were only
to bear their strict grammatical meaning. The
article regarding the Russians underwent more
discussion. Sir Hew insisted, that this was a
point referable to the Admiral, and that if he
did not agree to it, it must be struck out; with
this understanding on the part of the French
negotiator that article was framed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junot returns to Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While Kellermann was thus employed in the
British camp, Junot occupied the positions of
the Cabeça de Montechique and Mafra, and
hastened himself to Lisbon. On the 20th official<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
intelligence had been published in that city that
Laborde had sustained an action with the English
army, and though he had only 2000 men, had
kept his ground against it; in the night he had
taken a position conformably to his orders, for
the purpose of joining the Commander-in-chief;
their junction had been formed, the enemy were
in a strait, and would be attacked on the morrow,
when they would be made to see what the
French could do: two English regiments had
been destroyed in the action. The people, however,
understood by reports more worthy of belief
than any official statements of the enemy,
that the English had been successful at Roliça.
The news of the battle of Vimeiro also reached
them at nightfall of the 22d; it was asserted,
not only that Junot had been defeated, but that
he was taken prisoner; the people openly congratulated
each other in the streets, and the
exultation and stir at the Ave Maria hour were
such as to indicate an insurrection. None of
the French deemed it prudent to appear, except
General Travot, who relied, and not in vain,
upon that personal good-will which he had obtained
by a conduct always humane and honourable.
At daybreak of the 23d, a letter from
Junot was published, dated from the field of
battle, at four in the afternoon. It stated that
the English had been attacked at nine o’clock
that morning, in the fortified position which they
occupied, and that in an instant they had been
dislodged from all their advanced points. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
left of the French army had obtained from the
first complete success; their right having to take
a circuitous course, could not arrive in time to
decide the action entirely; it had continued till
two o’clock, and they should probably finish it
on the morrow. At two they had taken a position,
and were three leagues nearer the enemy
than on the preceding day. The loss of the
English had been great. “On our part,” said
Junot, “there have been 150 killed, and from
300 to 400 wounded. We are stronger now,
fresh troops having reached me ... to-morrow,
therefore ...” there the sentence was broken off,
and General Travot concluded the bulletin by
saying, that many of the enemy’s superior officers
had been killed or wounded, that the Commander-in-chief
was well, and in a few days would be in
Lisbon. He arrived, in fact, that afternoon, with
the reserve, and such of the wounded as could
be removed. A royal salute was fired from the
Castle, as if he had returned victorious; but the
countenances of the French, even the generals
themselves, belied this manifestation of success.

It was soon rumoured that a capitulation had
been proposed, and no doubt could be entertained
concerning this when it was known that
an English officer arrived that night in company
with Kellermann, and that a boat had been sent
off to the English fleet.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General Freire dissatisfied with the armistice.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The British army marched on the morning
after the armistice was signed, and took a position
near the village of Ramalhal, this movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
being made merely for convenience. The Portugueze
General, Bernardim Freire, visited the
Commander-in-chief there; and received a copy
of the armistice: he was dissatisfied with it, and
promised to send a confidential officer to communicate
with him thereupon. Accordingly Major
Ayres Pintode Sousa soon arrived at Sir Hew’s
head-quarters. His strongest objections related
to that article which stipulated that no persons
should be molested for their political conduct;
that being a question, he said, which it was for
the Portugueze government to decide. It appeared
evident to Sir Hew, that General Freire
was offended because there was no mention of
the Junta of Porto in the armistice. His answer
was, that the government of Portugal, to which
the decision of this point would belong, nowhere
existed; and moreover the measure was wholly
military, and admitted of no delay; he desired,
however, that General Freire would state in
writing whatever observations he had to make,
and promised that they should be most favourably
considered in the progress of the negotiation.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulty concerning the Russian squadron.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There arose a difficulty now respecting the
Russian fleet. Notwithstanding the preparations
of defence which had been made on board their
ships, the feelings of the Russians and of their
Admiral were not with the French, and all Junot’s
endeavours to make their presence available for
the increase of his own means were in vain. Sir
Arthur Wellesley had learnt, when he visited the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
British squadron off the Tagus, that it was Admiral
Siniavin’s intention to take no part in the
contest between the two contending powers, but
claim the protection of a neutral port. It was
his opinion, that if they conducted themselves
upon this principle, they ought not to be molested,
and that it mattered not what became of
their ships, so they were not allowed to return
to the Baltic. In Sir Hew’s judgement the Admiral
was the best, if not the only judge of the
question, and to him accordingly the stipulation
in the armistice concerning them had been referred.
Sir C. Cotton refused to ratify it; and
upon this Sir Arthur recommended the Commander
to put an end to the armistice, and lose
no farther time in advancing, leaving it for Junot
to renew the negotiation if he thought proper.
The Commander was of a different opinion; good
faith, he thought, required that the Admiral’s
sentiments should be communicated to General
Junot; but he notified to him, at the same time,
that the armistice must be at an end in forty-eight
hours, and Colonel Murray, who was the
bearer of this notice, was authorized to negotiate
a convention.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Convention of Cintra.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The question concerning the Russians was adjusted
between the two Admirals. It was agreed
that the ships should be held as a deposit by
Great Britain, to be restored within six months
after the conclusion of peace between Russia and
that power; and that the men should be conveyed
to their own country at the expense of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
the British Government, without any condition
or stipulation respecting their future services.
The definitive convention also was soon concluded.
The terms were, that the French army
should evacuate Portugal with their arms and
baggage, not be considered prisoners of war, be
furnished with means of conveyance by the English
government, and disembarked in any of the
ports between Rochefort and l’Orient, and be at
liberty to serve on their arrival. They were to
take with them all their artillery of French calibre,
with the horses belonging to it, and the
tumbrils supplied with sixty rounds per gun, all
their equipments, and all that is comprehended
under the name of property of the army; and all
individuals of the army were to be at liberty to
dispose of their private property of every description,
with full security for the purchasers. The
horses of the cavalry and of the officers were to
be embarked, those of the former not exceeding
600, those of the latter not exceeding 200; and
as the means of conveyance for horses were very
limited, facility should be given them for disposing
of those which could not be embarked.
The garrisons of Elvas, Peniche, and Palmella,
were to be embarked at Lisbon, that of Almeida
at Porto, or the nearest harbour, and British commissaries
were to provide for their subsistence
and accommodation on the march. The sick and
wounded who were not in a state to be removed
were entrusted to the British army, their expenses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
while they remained to be discharged
by the British Government, and reimbursed by
France. Should doubts arise as to the meaning
of any article, it was to be interpreted favourably
to the French. From the date of the ratification
of this convention, all arrears of contributions,
requisitions, or claims whatever of the French
Government against the subjects of Portugal, or
any other individuals residing in that country,
founded on the occupation of Portugal by the
French troops, should be cancelled, all sequestrations
upon their property removed, and the free
disposal of the same restored to the proper owners.
All subjects of France, or of powers in alliance
with France, domiciliated in Portugal, or accidentally
there, should be protected, their property
respected, and themselves at liberty either
to remain in the country, or to accompany the
French army. No Portugueze was to be held
accountable for his political conduct; and all who
had continued in office, or accepted it, under the
French Government, were placed under the protection
of the British commanders, and were to
sustain no injury either in their persons or property,
for it had not been at their choice to obey
the French or not: if they chose to sell their
property and remove, the term of one year should
be allowed them for that purpose. The Spanish
troops detained at Lisbon were to be given up
to the British Commander, and he engaged to
obtain from the Spaniards the release of such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
French subjects, as, not having been taken in
battle, nor in consequence of military operations,
were now detained in Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />September.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>That this convention, considered in a military
point of view, was advantageous to Great Britain,
was the opinion of all the British Generals.
By effecting the immediate deliverance of Portugal,
it left the British army at liberty to advance
into Spain, and reach the main scene of action in
time for the great struggle which was expected
there. The details of the treaty were thought
of inferior consideration. Kellermann had declared
that the French would not submit to
severer terms, but that if such were insisted on,
they would retire to the strong fortresses in their
possession, defend themselves there till the last
extremity, and destroy Lisbon before they abandoned
it. There was no reason to think that
any compunction would withhold them from
doing this; and though it might possibly have
been prevented by bringing on an action, that
action must have been fought in the immediate
vicinity of Lisbon, perhaps in the city itself.
Motives of humanity therefore had their weight
with the Commander-in-chief in making such
large concessions to an enemy, who, if they had
met with sterner treatment, better suited to their
deserts, would presently have lowered their tone,
and been glad to accept of any terms which should
secure them a safe embarkation.</p>

<p>The military advantages of the convention were
not over-rated; it will indeed appear hereafter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
that they proved greater than had been foreseen.
But some political errors were committed
in framing it; and the British Generals did not
assume that moral tone which the occasion justified,
and which the soundest policy required.
Buonaparte was designated in the armistice as
his imperial and royal majesty, although Great
Britain had never acknowledged him either as
Emperor of the French or King of Italy. Junot
was allowed to sign the convention as Duke of
Abrantes, a title to which he had no better right
than to the property which he had amassed in
Portugal by rapine. Sir Arthur Wellesley had
recommended, pending the negotiation, that
some mode should be devised “for making the
French Generals disgorge the church plate which
they had stolen.” An article had been framed
accordingly, specifying in direct terms that the
property of churches, monasteries, and palaces
should not be carried away. But this article was
withdrawn, on the repeated representations of
Kellermann that its introduction into a public
monument would be reproachful to the French
army. The Commander-in-chief, he said, was
particularly desirous it should be omitted; and
he was willing, on that condition, to pledge his
word of honour that no property of this kind
should be removed. Except in the case of some
carriages which the court had left behind, and
some beasts taken for the service of the army,
he disclaimed all knowledge of any such appropriation
of Portugueze property by the French<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
as was imputed to them; and if there were any
officers who had thus acted, he expressed a hope
that they might reap no benefit from their misconduct.
With regard to the churches, a contribution
had been regularly levied on them for
the public service, and its produce expended;
this of course the English could not mean to
redemand. The confidence with which these
representations were urged, imposed for a time
upon honourable men, and the obnoxious article
was withdrawn upon the very ground for which
it ought to have been retained.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Remonstrances of the Portugueze Commander.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The convention was concluded on the 30th of
August, and ratified by the British Commander,
not at Cintra, from which place it has been denominated,
but at Torres Vedras. It was communicated
immediately to General Bernardim
Freire. The reply from that General was, that
he was in some measure responsible to the Provisional
Government for obtaining for the Portugueze
whatever could be useful and honourable
to the state; but there was not in the whole treaty
a single article relating to the Portugueze army.
It became therefore his duty to inquire how far
the engagement contracted with the French for
the restoration of their civil officers who were in
the hands of the Portugueze extended? if the
Provisional Government, taking advantage of his
conduct in having taken no part in these arrangements,
should order him to act in co-operation
with the Spanish army in Alem-Tejo against the
French, would the British army oppose any such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
intention? and if the honour and dignity of the
Portugueze nation, and the authority of the
Prince, should seem to have been compromised
by these arrangements, would the British Generals
take upon themselves to answer for it?
Ayres Pinto, when he delivered this reply, declared
that he did justice to the friendship and
loyalty of the British nation, and individually
felt himself highly honoured by the manner in
which Sir Hew had received him; “nevertheless,”
said he, “your Excellency must well know
that the public will judge of us not by our private
conduct, but by that which bears an authentic
character; and there is no other means of avoiding
the ill will of the public than by obtaining
from your Excellency a reply which may convince
the Portugueze people that the General to whom
the direction of their forces is confided, has
yielded only to urgent circumstances, and to the
absolute necessity of not compromising the army
under his command.”</p>

<p>If the Portugueze General had not separated
from the British army, contrary to the advice
and request of Sir Arthur Wellesley, he would
of course have been a party to the negotiation.
Sir Hew, upon occasion of the armistice, had
desired him to state his sentiments fully while
the negotiations were in progress; not having
received one word of comment during that time,
he expressed his surprise at this late expostulation
on terms to which the honour of the British
Commanders was pledged, as far as their influence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
or power could be supposed to extend
by the common and known laws of war. But
to this it was replied, that Ayres Pinto had personally
communicated the General’s objections
to the conditions of the armistice, representing
that the Portugueze army and the Government
were treated too cavalierly in this transaction;
that some notice should be taken of them, were
it only to prevent factious persons from raising
injurious reports; that the French were not
strong enough to deserve so much consideration;
and that the Portugueze were now in a
condition to demand account from them of the
robberies, rapines, depredations, murders, and
sacrileges of every kind which they had committed
in that kingdom, and which called for
exemplary vengeance. The Portugueze Commander
now poured in his representations and
complaints. It was his duty to declare, he said,
that not having been consulted on, or privy to
this negotiation, in which he supposed his country
was concerned, he considered himself exempt
from all responsibility for it. He complained
that no notice had been taken in the armistice
of the troops under the Monteiro Mor in Alem-Tejo,
nor of the Spanish army of Extremadura
which had entered that province. The British
army, he affirmed, could not, and ought not to
be considered in any other light than an auxiliary
army; as such it had been applied for by
the Provisional Government, and as such it was
still to be regarded, let its strength be what it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
might. Under these circumstances any treaty
with the French ought to have been made in
conjunction with the Portugueze Government,
and with its full approbation. He protested
finally against the treaty in the whole and in
its separate parts, ... in the whole, because it contained
no consideration of the Prince Regent or
the Government which represented him; in its
parts, because no declaration was made that what
places, stores, and ships were to be taken possession
of should be restored to the Portugueze
Government; because it stipulated for the impunity
of individuals who had betrayed their
country; and because it made no provision for
the security of the people of Lisbon and its neighbourhood
while the French continued there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reply of Sir Hew Dalrymple.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These representations were in some respects
well founded; they were mingled with futile
matter, and there was also a covert purport in
them, which Sir Hew Dalrymple perfectly understood,
of exciting a popular feeling in favour
of the Junta of Porto, that body being desirous
of prolonging and extending its authority, after
the circumstances which alone rendered it legitimate
had ceased. Leaving this question untouched,
Sir Hew replied, with a courtesy and
frankness that disarm resentment. It was not
possible, he said, to engage the existing Government
of Portugal in a negotiation purely military
in its nature, and in which no reference was
had either to the Governments of England or
of France. With regard to the indemnity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
political offences, it was natural that the French
should demand it; and to him it appeared that
the treaty afforded a fair occasion for remitting
punishments which, by keeping political animosity
alive, would not have tended to the tranquillity
and happiness of the country. There was
little reason to suppose that persons who had
thus rendered themselves obnoxious would venture
to remain long after the French; if they
did, they would of course be vigilantly observed,
and their future treatment would depend upon
their future conduct. It was not from any want
of personal respect to General Freire that he did
not enter into the discussion of points which it
was only incumbent on him to explain to the
Government of the country. But being aware
of the calumnies which had been disseminated
by the enemy in other countries, as now in this,
he assured his Excellency, and would use the necessary
means for giving publicity to the pledge,
that he served in Portugal as the Commander of
a force acting in alliance with the Sovereign of
that country; and therefore considered himself
bound by duty and honour to pay as strict a
regard to the interests of the Prince Regent, the
dignity and security of his Government, and the
welfare of the nation of which he was the lawful
ruler, as even his Excellency himself. But as
touching the cessions, he did not see in what
terms they could have been better framed. “The
nominal Duke of Abrantes,” said Sir Hew, “is
not the guardian of the Prince Regent’s interests;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
and if any pledge is necessary of the pure and
disinterested views of the Sovereign I have the
honour to serve, I do not think it was through
the stipulations of a treaty with that General that
it could most properly be conveyed.” The manifest
good faith and the temper of this reply
produced their proper effect, and General Freire
expressed his satisfaction in it as promising the
most happy, prompt, and secure accomplishment
of the object at which they aimed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The British flag hoisted in the forts.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the British troops entered Lisbon the
Russian Admiral wrote to Sir Hew to inquire
what flag was to be displayed when the forts on
the Tagus were delivered up, and whether, if
the Portugueze flag were hoisted, the port would
be considered neuter, and his squadron entitled
to the benefit of that neutrality. Sir Hew replied,
that if he felt authorized to interfere in a
business which had been exclusively referred to
Sir C. Cotton, he could easily anticipate the
answer which that Commander would make.
Contrary, however, to his expectation, when two
regiments were landed from the fleet, and took
possession of the ports on the river, the British
flag was hoisted. The Portugueze were naturally
hurt at this; but before their General
could offer any representation on the subject,
Sir Hew had ordered the Portugueze colours to
be displayed in its stead. The negotiation concerning
the Russian squadron had not been concluded
when the question was proposed to the
British General, and it was to settle in a summary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
way Admiral Siniavin’s claim to the protection
of a neutral port that the English flag had
been planted by Sir C. Cotton.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Anarchy in Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the negotiation Lisbon was in a dreadful
state. Those wretches who, to the reproach
of Christian states and civilized society, are bred
in the corruption of all great cities, took advantage
of the temporary dissolution of government
as they would have done of a conflagration or an
earthquake. The soldiers of the police, being
Portugueze, had almost all gone to join their
countrymen in arms; and the French while they
went the rounds, suffered robberies to be committed
in their hearing and in their sight, either
not understanding the cries for help, or not
choosing to interfere, now that their reign was
at an end. They indeed themselves were in
such danger, that they soon gave over patrolling
the streets, and fired upon those who approached
their quarters in the night. In this manner several

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Observador Portuguez, 420, 501–3.
<br />
Neves, v. 202.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Portugueze were shot; the French venturing
upon this, not so much in the confidence
of their own strength, as in full reliance upon the
interference of the English to protect them.</p>

<p>There had been a great error of judgement in
not following up the victory at Vimeiro; and in
the subsequent negotiations the British Generals
had taken a lower tone than the enemy expected,
or circumstances required. But they were more
censurable for having failed to manifest that moral
sense of the enemy’s conduct which individually
they felt, and yet collectively seemed for a time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
to have suppressed for the sake of professional
considerations and courtesy, never more unworthily
bestowed. The soldiers of Buonaparte
in Portugal had forfeited all claim to those courtesies
which honourable men will always delight
in rendering to honourable enemies. They had
disgraced their profession and their country, and
it behoved the British, for the sake of theirs, to
have testified their sense of this in the most decided
manner. But instead of shunning any
farther intercourse than was necessary for the
execution of the treaty, they entered into social
intercourse with the French, entertainments were
mutually given, and British Generals sate at Junot’s
table in company with the men who were
responsible for the horrors committed at Evora
and Leiria. They were not fully informed of
those crimes, and certainly did not believe Junot
and his people to be so thoroughly destitute of
honour as they soon found them. But proof
enough of their wickedness had been given in
public and official acts; and in thus appearing for
a time to forget the real character of the cause in
which Great Britain was engaged, a moral fault,
as well as a political error, was committed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French continue to plunder.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Elated no doubt by this, as well as by their
success in negotiation, the French continued that
system of public and private robbery for which
they seemed to think the convention had granted
them entire impunity. General Freire complained
to Sir Hew Dalrymple that they were
plundering the treasury, the museum, public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
libraries, arsenals, churches, and the houses and
stores of individuals. The British commissioners
for carrying the convention into effect, Major-General
Beresford and Lord Proby, informed
him, that except the military and naval stores
there was no kind of public property which the
French intended to relinquish; that they meant
to carry off the valuables of the Prince, the
plunder of the churches, and much of the property
of individuals; that they had packed up
the royal library, and most of the articles of the
museum; that during the negotiation they had
taken a sum of about £22,000 from the <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Deposito
Publico</i>, which was in fact a robbery of individuals,
that money being deposited there till litigations
concerning it should be decided; and
that even after the terms were signed they had
actually demanded the money arising from the
revenues of the country. The merchants of Lisbon
addressed a memorial to the British Commander,
stating that Junot had exacted from
them a forced loan of two million <i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">cruzados</i>, promising
that payment should be made out of the
enormous war-contribution which he had imposed;
they had not been paid, and it was now
his intention to depart without paying them;
they therefore prayed for redress, and likewise
that some steps should be taken for recovering
their ships and property which had been unlawfully
sequestered in France.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Question concerning baggage.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There was something absolutely comic in the
impudent persuasion of the French that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
might continue to pillage, and carry off what they
pleased, under protection of the British army.
They proposed to take away the Vasco da Gama
and some Portugueze frigates; the Gama, it may
be remembered, was the ship wherein they had
embarked great part of the treasure which they
had collected. The reply was, that these vessels
did not belong to them, and they were only
to carry away their individual baggage. Junot
actually demanded five ships to remove his own
personal effects. Such a demand was of course
pronounced to be inadmissible. Sir Hew declared
he would not listen to any proposal which
compromised his own honour and that of the
British nation. He perceived, that owing to the
shameless and open manner in which the French
were preparing to carry off public and private
property, popular indignation was strongly excited,
and that because of the interpretation
which they by their conduct affected to give the
convention, this feeling was little less directed
against the English than the French. He instructed
the commissioners therefore to require
the restoration of these plundered goods; “by
this means,” said he, “affording a proof to the
Portugueze nation that we at least act with good
faith, and are therefore entitled to use the necessary
measures, however vigorous, for the protection
of those obnoxious persons for whose
safety that faith is pledged.”</p>

<p>The commissioners exercised their charge with
becoming firmness. The money taken from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
public deposit they compelled the French to promise
to replace, ... a concession which was not
obtained till after a very long discussion. The
spoils of the museum and royal library were also

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French endeavour to carry off articles from the Museum.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

reclaimed. They had been selected, General
Kellermann said, by M. Guiffroi, a member of
the National Institute: the objection, indeed, on
the part of the English, he admitted to be well
founded; nevertheless, he observed that these
articles, consisting chiefly of specimens in natural
history, and interesting manuscripts, were,
in general, duplicates, ... that they were precious
acquisitions for the sciences; ... the sciences were
of all countries, and far from making war upon
them, we ought to promote their communication.
They wished, therefore, to select articles
of natural history at their pleasure, and to leave
for them such compensations as the English might
think proper. Of course, the British commander
returned a most decided negative, saying he
could not sell articles which were not his, and
would not allow them to be removed: and the
French general was compelled to issue a general
order, commanding all individuals of the French
army, or administration, to make restitution of
whatever they had taken from any public or private
establishment, within four-and-twenty hours.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They embark horses, carriages, and pictures, which are recovered.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was something to have wrung from them
such a confession of robbery; yet within a few
hours after this very order had been issued,
Junot’s first aide-de-camp, Colonel de Cambis,
carried off the Prince Regent’s horses from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
royal stables, to embark them as General Junot’s
property. Having been compelled to restore
them, this same officer the next day endeavoured
in like manner to carry off two carriages belonging
to the Duke of Sussex, and it was necessary
to threaten him with being carried prisoner to
England, if he persisted in this sort of conduct.
It was ascertained that Junot had embarked a
collection of pictures from the house of the
Marques de Angeja; restitution was demanded,
and he said they had been given to him. This
was found to be false; and Junot then laid the
affair upon a relation of his who was embarked
with him, but who immediately endeavoured
to conceal himself in one of the transports. A
threat of detaining the General brought this person
back; he was ordered on shore, to give an
account of the transaction, and as he refused
to acknowledge the jurisdiction of the commissioners,
or to land, was compelled to do both,
and to produce the pictures.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They carry off large sums in money.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But in other cases the commissioners were
bound by the letter of a treaty, in which it now
appeared that one party could not have presumed
too little upon the honour of the other,
nor one too much. All the money which these
plunderers had collected they were allowed to
carry off. Sir Hew observed, that this description
of property could never come under the provisions
of the treaty, and that it was impossible
to identify it, or prove exactly from whom it was
obtained. But Ayres Pinto had pointed out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
simple and satisfactory mode of proof: the French
had brought no Portugueze money with them,
consequently, whatever they possessed in it must
have been the fruits of rapine. Yet the French
carried off three months’ pay for the whole army,
in the general military chest, and, besides this,
distributed large sums to the different regiments,
to be carried off in their regimental chests. One
regiment alone was said to have taken 100,000
crowns with it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Question concerning the silver in bars.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French had also a great quantity of silver
in bars, into which they had reduced the pillage
of the churches and palaces, for the sake of easier
conveyance. Kellermann strenuously insisted
that the convention guaranteed to them whatever
was in their possession previous to the first
day of the truce, and declared, most positively,
that they never would concede this point. The
commissioners, on the contrary, insisted upon
the article which restricted them from carrying
off other than military and personal baggage;
and they declared that the Commander-in-chief
would never consent to any other construction.
At length they compromised the dispute: the
French, though they would not acknowledge
that, by the treaty, they were under any obligation,
proposed to pay the debts of the army with
this silver, for which purpose, they said, it had
ever been expressly intended, and agreed, that if
any remained after these debts were discharged,
it should be delivered up. The commissioners
acknowledged, that, by the convention, they could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
scarcely require more; and Sir Hew pronounced
that the offer was fair, and might be acceded to.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Further instances of dishonour in the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The commissioners, however, were soon convinced
that concession was not the likeliest expedient
for avoiding new pretensions. The ingenuity
of man, they said, could not provide
against French cavil, and ingenuity in misconstruction;
and in consequence of the perpetual
subterfuges and false promises of Kellermann,
they insisted upon the establishment of a committee,
to inquire into all the claims presented
by the Portugueze, and to be invested with full
authority to summon persons, and to order restitution.
Property to a very great amount, both
private and public, was recovered by these means.
Information was obtained that fifty-three boxes
of indigo were embarked as part of Junot’s baggage:
the indigo was found and seized: the
French general, of course, disclaimed any knowledge
of the transaction; and the commissioners,
without hesitation, assured him that every officer
in the British army would acquit him personally
on this head, because it was impossible for him
to inspect or know what was done in his name!
A bold and well-supported attempt was made to
avoid the repayment of the money taken from
the Deposito Publico, and a compensation for
articles taken from the public magazines since the
convention, amounting in the whole to £40,000.
The justice of this demand had been acknowledged,
and immediate payment promised. Nevertheless,
it had not been made when Junot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
embarked, and when he was called upon to fulfil
his agreement, Kellermann pleaded that the
money remaining in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Caisse Militaire</i> did not
amount to the £60,000, which, by the explanation
of the convention, was admitted to be a fair
military chest, and therefore he considered the
agreement to repay these sums as cancelled. The
first division of the French had already sailed,
but the commissioners applied to Sir Charles
Cotton to detain the second, and the Commander-in-chief,
till that point should be satisfactorily
settled. Even after this instance of vigour, much
litigation and discussion was permitted; and
when, at length, Kellermann yielded to necessity,
attempts were still made to put off the payment,
till no means of enforcing it should be
left. During the three last days that Junot remained
in the river, orders were repeatedly given
to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">payeur-general</i> to pay this money, and
they were always evaded, under some frivolous
pretext; till at last the commissioners ordered
him and his baggage on shore to the arsenal, and
then the Frenchman reluctantly refunded this
part of the plunder.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Protests of the Monteiro Mor and of the Juiz do Povo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the commissioners were thus recovering
from the French a part of that wealth which they
had collected by every means of oppression and
violence, the strong interference of the British
alone preserved these plunderers from the vengeance
of the people. The popular feeling was
partaken by all ranks. The Monteiro Mor, who
had now advanced to Azeitam, addressed a protest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
to the British Admiral against the treaty,
because the Prince and his Government had not
been consulted; and because no attention had
been paid to himself, who, without any foreign
aid, had found means to expel the enemy from
the kingdom of Algarve, and pursuing them,
passing on to Alem-Tejo, and compelling them
to evacuate all their posts, had taken a position
with his army on the south bank of the Tagus.
Such fanfaronade could only detract from his
own deserts, and discredit the exertions and the
sufferings of a brave and loyal nation. He accompanied
this protest by a request, that, on
account of the robberies and atrocities which the
French had committed, the vessels employed to
carry them home might be embargoed till the
King of England and the Prince of Brazil should
have resolved on what was best for the honour
and interest of the two nations; and he required
that their baggage should be rigorously searched
by Portugueze and English commissioners, lest
they should carry away with them the booty
which they had so infamously obtained. The
Juiz do Povo also presented a protest; though the
convention had not been published, the people,
he said, knew there was no mention made in it
of the three states of the kingdom, and that it
left them without satisfaction for the crimes both
against divine and human laws, and without
vengeance for the murders, robberies, and atrocities
of every kind, which the usurpers had committed.
“Our churches stript,” said he, “the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
royal palaces damaged, the royal treasury plundered,
the people reduced to poverty and misery,
so that the streets and squares of the capital are
rendered impassable by crowds of beggars, ... nothing
of this is taken into consideration: ... yet
the safety of kingdoms depends on not letting
their rights be invaded without punishing the
offenders, and the consequence of permitting
such crimes with impunity will occasion incalculable
misfortunes. The people and the officers
of this tribunal declare their gratitude to the generous
allies who have liberated Portugal, but
they pray for the suspension of a convention so
favourable to the French as this is said to be. It
must be invalid after the abuses and hostilities
which they have continued to commit in Almeida,
and the contribution which they have
since extorted; and this tribunal cannot consent
to the return of the enemy to France, as they
already threaten that they will come back to
destroy what they have left.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Danger of tumults in Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Such language from a magistrate whose name
was never heard but in turbulent times, increased
the popular ferment; and General Hope, who
now commanded in Lisbon, found it necessary
to issue a proclamation, prohibiting the Portugueze
from entering the city with arms, or wearing
them in the streets; and enacting that all
places where wine was sold should be shut at
six in the evening, and not opened before sunrise.
To enforce these regulations, and maintain
order, strong guards, picquets, and patroles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
were appointed to arrest every person who should
break the peace. Nothing but this prompt vigilance
prevented the people from gratifying their
thirst for vengeance. It is said that all the houses
in Belem in which the enemy were lodged were
marked in the course of one night, and that lists
of those Frenchmen and their adherents who were
deemed most worthy of death were posted up.
The English were loudly reproached for having
protected men who deserved the most exemplary
punishment; and there were not wanting
persons unreflecting enough to assert, that sure
as they were of the Spaniards, they could have
exacted that punishment without any necessity
for English aid. This feeling, however, was far
from general. The English character was too
well known in Lisbon, for the English name ever
to be unpopular among a people not less retentive
of kind and friendly feelings than of injuries.
When the English soldiers went to occupy the
arsenals and forts, refreshments were brought
out for them along the way, and British officers
were followed in the streets by applauding crowds;
while the hatred which was manifested towards
the French was so deep and general, that no
people could possibly have incurred it unless
they had deserved it to the utmost. Not only
did the Portugueze refuse to purchase from them
those things which they wished to convert into
money, they refused to sell them any thing, even
provisions for their hospital. If a Frenchman
ventured to appear alone, trusting to escape discovery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
he betook himself, upon the first suspicious
eye which was directed toward him, to an
Englishman for protection. Kellermann came
on shore one day after his embarkation to dine
with a British officer, and being recognized on
his return to the water-side, was attacked by the
mob. Our sailors defended and saved him, but
not before he had received some severe contusions.
Loison, who was a more marked object of
execration, was considered in so much personal
danger, that four battalions were bivouacked
near his quarters, and four pieces of cannon
planted there for his protection. But toward
those officers who had demeaned themselves
humanely and honourably, the people testified
nothing but respect and good-will.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Temper of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French were not sufficiently humbled to
bear this meekly. The success which they had
obtained in negotiation, in their minds more
than counterbalanced the humiliation of their
defeat, and of their present state. They denied
that they had been defeated; they affirmed that
they had dictated the terms; and Junot continued
to occupy the royal box at the opera till
his departure. The English generals respected,
in this instance, the custom of the country, and
after the Frenchman had resigned it, left it unoccupied,
with the curtain down. But however
much the enemy might console themselves with
the confident hope of again becoming masters of
the kingdom, their pride was bitterly wounded
by the display of national feeling which met them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
every where, and which they considered presumptuous
in a people who were soon to be
brought again under their iron yoke. They
called it audacity in the Portugueze to wear the
national cockade, which they still chose to denominate
a badge of insurrection; and they complained
that even in their sight lamps were prepared
for illuminating the city upon their departure,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Thiebault, 219–222.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and demanded in greater numbers than
could be supplied.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Embarkation of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first division of the French embarked
under protection of the second, the second and
third were protected by the British troops from
the fury of the Portugueze. Wholly to restrain
it was impossible, but no serious injury was done.
They embarked amid the curses of the people.
Nine days and nights the rejoicings continued,
not by any order from the magistracy, but by
the voluntary act of the inhabitants, whose joy
was in proportion to the misery from which they
had been delivered. It was a joy which thousands
whose fortunes had been ruined in the
general calamity, partook; and which brought
the last earthly consolation to many a broken
heart. The enemy, while they lay in the river,
were within sight of the illuminations and fire-works,
and could hear the bells with which that
great city rang from side to side. However
brave in arms, however skilful in negotiation,
they departed under circumstances more reproachful
than had ever before attached to any
army, or body of military men. As a last act<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of baseness, one of their general officers called
at the commissioners’ office, while they were
absent, just before he embarked, and carried off
all the papers he could collect, in the hope of
making it impossible for them to produce an
account of their proceedings. But he was driven
back to Lisbon by contrary winds, and compelled

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Final report of the commissioners.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to restore them. The commissioners concluded
the final report of their transactions by stating,
that the conduct of the French had been marked
by the most shameful disregard of honour and probity,
publicly evincing their intention of carrying
off their plundered booty, and leaving acknowledged
debts unpaid. “Finally, said they, they
have only paid what they were obliged to disgorge,
and were not permitted to carry off. The
British commissioners had represented to General
Kellermann, that whatsoever the words, it could
never be the spirit of any convention, that an
army should, as a military chest, or otherwise,
carry off public money, leaving public debts unpaid:
they had called upon him, for the honour
of the French army and nation, to act justly;
and yet, unmindful of any tie of honour or of
justice, the French army had taken away a considerable
sum in the military chest, leaving its
debts unpaid, to a very large amount.”</p>

<p>Thus the courtesy which had been shown
toward the French Generals in the course of the
negotiation, had the effect of fixing upon them
a deeper stigma; by bringing into full view a
low chicanery, a total want of honour, and utter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
disregard of truth, which could not have been
suspected, if it had not been thus officially proved,
and placed upon public record. Had such charges
been advanced by the enemy against the general
officers of a British army, the strictest inquiry
would have been instituted, and no rank, no
influence, no professional merits, could have
screened the offenders. They would have been
dismissed with ignominy from the service which
they had disgraced, and for ever excluded from
all honourable society. There was a time when
the highest eulogium which the French bestowed
upon a soldier was to say, that he was without
fear and without reproach; but under the system
of Buonaparte nothing was considered reproachful
in his soldiers, provided they feared nothing
in this world or in the next.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Addresses of thanks to the British Commander.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The good faith of the British, and their real
regard for the interest and feelings of the Portugueze
nation, were now apparent. The national
flag was every where displayed, and the people
were informed by a proclamation that no time
would be lost in establishing their government
upon the basis on which the Prince had left it,
and substituting the civil for that military power
which was continued only from necessity and for
a few days. The magistrates and the clergy meantime,
and all persons who possessed authority or
influence, were called upon to co-operate in preserving
order. Addresses of thanks came from
the provinces; and the Juiz do Povo, who had
protested in the name of the people of Lisbon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
so strongly against the convention, now for those
same people expressed their gratitude to the
British Commander, the British Sovereign, and
the British nation, requesting that their sincere
thanks for this great deliverance might be made
known to the smallest village as well as to the
throne. Such was the proud situation of the
British army at Lisbon. Some formalities had
been forgotten in the negotiation, some minor
interests had been overlooked, and the courtesies
of war had been too liberally accorded to an
enemy who should have been made to feel their
moral degradation. But the unstained honour,
the unsuspecting integrity, the open manliness,
the plain dignity of the British character, had
been manifested throughout the whole of these
transactions; and this was felt and acknowledged
by the Portugueze.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galluzo besieges Elvas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Difficulties which could not have been foreseen
arose concerning the delivery of Elvas. Galluzo,
who commanded the army of Extremadura, and
who had hitherto afforded no very efficient aid
to the Portugueze, thought proper at this time,
when he had been required by every civil and
military authority to begin his march towards
Castille, in contempt of those orders to enter
Alem-Tejo, and besiege Elvas, as if no treaty
for its surrender had been made. The French
Commandant, Girod de Novillars, upon this required
from the inhabitants an immediate loan
of money, to the amount of 30,000 francs, and
wine and provisions to the value of 20,000 more.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
Drained as they had been by repeated exactions,
the people of Elvas were in no condition to obey
this demand; the Bishop and the magistrates
therefore easily obtained permission to go to the
Spanish camp, and entreat Galluzo to suspend
hostilities. That General, however, declared,
that if the French did not surrender within six
hours, he would open his fire against Fort La
Lippe, and put the whole garrison to the sword.
He had no time to lose, he said, but must hasten
to assist his fellow-soldiers in expelling the enemy
from the Peninsula; and the inhabitants must
either abandon the city, or take arms against the
French. From this dilemma they were delivered
by the French themselves, who, during the night,
withdrew into the forts, leaving about an hundred
men in the hospital. An agreement was then
made, with Galluzo’s consent, that the city should
remain neutral; and the Spaniards began an
absurd fire against Fort La Lippe, which is the
strongest fortress in Portugal. Things were in
this state when Lieutenant-Colonel Ross arrived
with letters from the French Commander, instructing
M. Girod to give up the place to him
in pursuance of the convention. A demur was
made by the Commandant, till he could send
an officer to Lisbon, and satisfy himself that the
dispatches were authentic; and difficulties less
reasonable in their kind were started both by the
Spaniards and Portugueze. Galluzo argued that
no agreement between the British and French
Generals could be binding upon him. The Spaniards,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
he affirmed, had a right as besiegers to
take possession of Elvas, and the Spanish arms
were not to be defrauded of the splendour which
this would give them. He threatened Girod that
if any injury were offered to the city the prisoners
should be put to death, and the garrison receive
no mercy; and he insisted that they should march
out and lay down their arms, and that the place
should be entered and occupied by the Spaniards
only. In his communications with Sir Hew
Dalrymple he held rather a lower tone, saying
that certainly he should not have besieged and
cannonaded Elvas if he had known of the convention;
but it had not been thought proper to
announce it to him. He required only a joint
surrender to the British and Spanish arms, leaving
the place and the prisoners to his Excellency;
but he had heard the garrison were not to be
considered prisoners; that article, though the
opinion was that it would not be executed, occasioned
some uneasiness, and therefore he would
make them lay down their arms, and swear not
to bear them again against Spain or her allies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulties concerning the surrender of Elvas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Galluzo was at this time upon ill terms with
the Portugueze. They complained that throughout
the struggle in Alem-Tejo he had promised
much and performed little; that the Spaniards
had acted as masters in those fortresses which
they had entered as friends, countermanded the
orders of the Portugueze General, encouraged
insubordination, appropriated to their own use
money which had been raised for the national<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
cause, and pillaged the country as they passed
through it. On the other hand, Galluzo reproached
the Portugueze with want of activity
and energy, and with giving his people nothing
but water when they went to assist them. His
pretensions to Elvas, therefore, which under any
circumstances might have given offence, were
now peculiarly offensive; and it happened that
the Junta of Porto, who were at this time not
without hope of getting the government of the
kingdom into their own hands, had ordered General
Leite to march into Elvas and occupy it as
soon as it should be evacuated. The General
communicated their orders to Sir Hew, declaring
that he felt it his duty to obey, and laying before
him his complaints against the Spaniards. These
difficulties were surmounted by a proper mixture
of conciliation and firmness on the part of the
British Commander. The first great object was,
that British faith should be kept, and complete
protection afforded to the French garrison. For
this purpose those troops whom it was intended
to canton in Alem-Tejo were immediately ordered
thither, and stationed as near Elvas as possible.
Colonel Graham was sent to Galluzo to bring him
to reason; and if this were found impracticable,
then to proceed to Madrid, and call for the interference
of higher authorities. Colonel Ross was
instructed to bear in mind, that as the French
surrendered to no nation except the English,
neither Spanish nor Portugueze troops were to
appear when they marched out: that with respect<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
to the Portugueze, the feelings of the nation
were to be gratified, and their flag every where
displayed under a salute; but he was to hold the
substantial power, even if he saw cause for allowing
a Portugueze General to march in with a
detachment of his men. Colonel Graham performed
his difficult mission with great ability.
Galluzo ceased from all farther interference, and
was so gratified by the temper in which this affair
had been carried on by the British Commander,
and the services which had been rendered to the
soldiers of Extremadura who had been released
at Lisbon, that he ordered the black English
cockade to be blended with the red Spanish one
in his army, to mark his gratitude, as he informed
Sir Hew, and denote the intimate alliance between
the two countries.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Elvas and Almeida given up.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>All difficulties being at length removed, the
forts were delivered up, General Leite entered
the city, and the French garrison, between 1400
and 1500 in number, were marched to Aldea
Gallega. No insults were offered them on the
way; and they were joined by their comrades,
who, having been wounded at Evora, had been
left in that city, and treated with careful humanity
by the inhabitants. The garrison of Almeida
were not removed so easily. The Portugueze
had kept up an irregular blockade of that
fortress after Loison’s departure; they borrowed
fire-arms from the Spaniards of Ciudad Rodrigo,
and were so little scrupulous in their mode of
warfare, that a friar poisoned the water of a tank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
at which the cattle belonging to the garrison
used to drink. Almeida might long have defied
any efforts which the Portugueze or the Spaniards
in that quarter could have made against it; it
was, however, gladly delivered up, in conformity
to the convention, and the garrison were marched
to Porto, under a British escort, there to be embarked.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Tumults at Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

On the day of their arrival, they employed
themselves in converting as much of their
plunder as possible into money: purchasers were
not wanting, and their market continued the
whole day and night, horses being the ostensible
articles. Such a traffic excited the indignation
of all but those who were profiting by it; and
that indignation was excited to the highest pitch,
when, on the following morning, as the baggage
of the French was examined at the Castle of St.
Joam da Foz, in presence of the governor and of
Sir Robert Wilson, several rich church vestments
were found in one of the boxes. The horror
which the Portugueze feel at sacrilege is perhaps
hardly conceivable by those who are not acquainted
with them. The governor himself, on
this occasion, joined the populace in their outcry,
and immediately gave orders that no vessel should
be permitted to pass the castle. The news soon
reached Porto, exaggerated as it passed from
mouth to mouth; a mob collected, bent upon
putting the French to death; and some insults
were offered the English for protecting them.
The Bishop, Sir Robert Wilson, and many officers,
Portugueze and English, used their utmost exertions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
to quiet the tumult. They succeeded in
restoring peace at St. Joam da Foz: but the
crowd still continued on both sides the river;
and at an early hour of the morning some thousand
persons had assembled, with a determination
to attack the French on board the transports:
they placed artillery on both shores, and
mounted guns on board the ships. Fortunately
for the French, they were provided with sixty
rounds each man, and one of the transports in
which they were embarked was armed with six-pounders.
The Bishop and Sir Robert Wilson
again came down to mediate, and the latter was
employed, without intermission, from nine in the
morning till five in the afternoon in negotiating
between the French General and the populace.
It was in vain for the Frenchman to tell Sir
Robert that he was bound to see the articles of
capitulation executed to the very letter, ... that
was impossible: he had secured their lives, and
this was the utmost he could do. The mob insisted
that the French should be disembarked,
their baggage examined on shore, and that they
should leave their arms: there was no alternative,
and they were compelled to submit. No sooner
had they left the transports, than the rabble
boarded them, and began to plunder in their
turn: every thing was ransacked; the very provisions
and wearing apparel of the ship-owners
disappeared. Here, however, the tumult ended:
the more riotous of the populace retired with
their booty; the better classes were ashamed of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the disgrace which had thus been brought upon
them; and every possible reparation was made,
to the entire satisfaction of the British officers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Spanish troops at Lisbon embarked for Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>During the negotiation the French, who were
not ashamed to propose any thing, proposed that
an equal number of French prisoners should be
set at liberty, in exchange for the Spaniards
whom they had seized at Lisbon. This Sir Hew
declared to be inadmissible; the Spaniards, he
said, must be immediately set free, and not the
interests alone, but the feelings of the Spanish
nation were to be considered. He consented,
however, to obtain for them, if possible, the release
of such Frenchmen as had been arrested
in Spain during the troubles, not having been
taken in battle, or in consequence of military
operations. Humanity induced him to this;
and in communicating it to the Spanish authorities,
he relied upon Spanish generosity for
complying with his request for their deliverance.
The scene at Lisbon, when arms, horses, and
artillery were restored to the Spaniards who had
been so long detained prisoners, was one of those
spectacles at which the heart rejoices. They were
about 3800 in number, some 2000 having effected
their escape. The ceremony was made as public
and impressive as possible, and the Spanish Commander
distributed alms upon the occasion among
the poor of Lisbon, which caused a general festivity.
Applications for these troops were made
from various parts of Spain. The Junta of Galicia
required them; and some of the Spanish Generals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
at Madrid wished them to be embarked for Santander,
there to join Blake’s army. Castaños, to
whose judgement at this time that deference was
paid which his great services had well deserved,
was of opinion that they would be more serviceable
in Catalonia than in any other part.
For Catalonia therefore they were embarked
in British transports, and Sir Hew advanced a
loan of 90,000 dollars to purchase horses for
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Intrigues of the Junta of Porto.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was sufficient for the British Commander
in these transactions to follow the plain dictates
of a humane and honourable mind. In settling
a civil government, and thereby putting an end
to the fearful anarchy which every where prevailed,
he had a more delicate task. The Junta
of Porto were intriguing to obtain a continuance
of their power; and under a pretext that Lisbon
would for some time be in a state of great confusion,
they made their wishes known to Sir Hew,
that the seat of the temporary government might
remain at Porto, and that deputies from the other
provinces, as they then did from the northern
ones, should repair thither to transact business
for those parts which they represented. The
Bishop also observed, that an authority had been
forced upon him, which he had accepted only in
the hope of re-establishing the government of his
lawful Prince; and that if it were thought expedient
for him to retain it till the pleasure of
the Prince was known, it must be under the condition
of remaining at Porto, from whence the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
inhabitants would not permit him to depart, unless
by a direct order of their Sovereign. Such
an arrangement would be most beneficial to the
kingdom in its present state; and that opposition
to it which might otherwise be expected, would
be obviated if Sir Hew Dalrymple would take
upon himself to recommend it. This sort of
finesse was little likely to attain its end with a
British Commander. Sir Hew, who was better
acquainted with the state of affairs in Spain than
any other person at that time, had no such advantage
in Portugal. But in politics, as in
morals, there is a principle of rectitude which
always leads us right, and that principle he followed.
He neither lent himself to this intrigue,
nor allowed the displeasure which it naturally
excited to preponderate against the real services
which the Bishop of Porto had rendered to his
country, and the popularity which in consequence
he then possessed. He replied therefore
to the Bishop, that had there been no objection,
the Council of Regency which the Prince
had appointed at his departure, would now have
resumed their authority of course; but seeing
that some of its members were strongly suspected
of being in the French interest, he felt
himself authorized to state, that however desirous
the King his Sovereign might be to interfere
as little as possible in the internal affairs
of Portugal, it was impossible for his Majesty,
under the peculiar circumstances of the case, to
acquiesce in the return of those persons to power.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
On the other hand, those members who had kept
aloof from the interests of the enemy, and retaining
their loyalty had retained the confidence of
the nation, had an unquestionable claim to be
reinstated in their situations. Declaring therefore
that his instructions were to take measures
for forming a Regency as soon as possible, composed
of such persons of rank, character, and
talents, as might be found ready to undertake,
and qualified to discharge, the important trust,
but with as few changes (particularly in the subordinate
departments) as might be compatible
with the public interests, in the fulfilment of
this duty he naturally addressed himself to his
Excellency and the Provisional Board of Government
at Porto. “You,” Sir Hew continued,
“have already turned your thoughts to the
great question now at issue, and are doubtless
prepared to propose measures for completing
the Council of Regency so as to merit the confidence
of the nation, and to prevent any just
cause of discontent in any other provisional
government, or other respectable description of
the people. For my own part, I have only been
able, from the information I have received since
my arrival in Portugal, to form one decided
opinion on this subject; which is, the infinite
importance to the public welfare that your Excellency
should yourself hold a distinguished
place in the proposed Regency.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Council of Regency re-established.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Bishop’s reply was, that he should readily
acquiesce in whatever might be determined upon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
except his own nomination to the Council; for
he, better than any other person, knew what
was necessary for the good of the public cause,
and of the northern provinces, and therefore
would not remove from the place where he had
been stationed by God and by his Prince. It
was soon, however, ascertained, that if this
Prelate could not remain at the head of the
government at Porto, he would not persist in
refusing to accept a share in it at Lisbon. Sir
Hew therefore, upon mature deliberation, and
with the best advice which could be obtained,
issued a proclamation, saying, that through the
success with which Providence had blessed the
British arms, the time was come when the re-establishment
of the Portugueze government

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

could be effected. He gave the people due
praise for the exertions which they had made
against the French; and saying that no views of
interest or of national aggrandizement could be
imputed to the liberal policy of Great Britain,
declared, that the best manner in which he could
fulfil the intentions of his Sovereign, and promote
the welfare of Portugal, was by restoring
that Council to which their Prince had delegated
his authority when he preserved his royal dignity
from the insults of an implacable enemy, and
secured his American dominions. One of that
Council had been unhappily sent away from his
country; others had incurred imputations which
rendered their restoration impossible at this time.
The three, however, who had contracted no such<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
disability, the Monteiro Mor, D. Francisco Xavier
de Noronha, and Francisco da Cunha e Menezes,
he called upon to resume the administration, and
with them the Desembargador Joam Antonio

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Salter de Mendonça, and Brigadier D. Miguel
Pereira Forjas Coutinho, whom the Prince had
named to succeed in case of vacancies. These
persons assembled accordingly, and to fill up the
number which the act of regency appointed,
elected the Marquez daz Minas and the Bishop
of Porto. The Junta of Porto then dissolved
itself, declaring, however, that if the Regency
should again be overthrown by any new invasion
of the enemy, (which they prayed God to avert,)
or any other calamity, they should by that event
enter again upon the full exercise of the authority
which they now laid aside. The other Juntas
were in like manner dissolved: the Regency was
acknowledged throughout Portugal, and things
resumed, as far as possible, their former course.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Outcry in England against the Convention.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While Sir Hew Dalrymple was employed in
carrying the terms of the convention into effect,
putting an end to the anarchy which prevailed,
and preparing with all possible speed to advance
into Spain, an outcry which he little expected
had arisen against him at home. The official
account of the battle reached England a fortnight
before the news of the armistice and convention:
tidings came with it that the French
had proposed to evacuate Portugal, and the news
of Junot’s unconditional surrender was looked for
as what must necessarily ensue. When the terms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
of the convention were received the Park and
Tower guns were fired; but the public feeling
was not in accord with this demonstration of joy,
and never was any public feeling so unanimously
and instantaneously manifested. The hopes of
the nation had been raised to the highest pitch;
their disappointment was in proportion, and it
was expressed with a violence only to be explained
by the deep and general abhorrence
which the conduct of the French in Portugal
had provoked. The capitulations of the Helder
and of Buenos Ayres were remembered as less
mortifying than the convention of Cintra. Nothing
else could be talked of, nothing else could
be thought of: men greeted each other in the
streets with execrations upon those who had
signed this detested convention; it kept them
waking at night, or disturbed their sleep, like a
misdeed or a misfortune of their own. The London
newspapers joined in one cry of wonder and
abhorrence; on no former occasion had they been
so unanimous. The provincial papers proved
that, from one end of the island to the other, the
resentment of this grievous disappointment was
the same; some refused to disgrace their pages
by inserting the treaty; others surrounded it
with broad black lines, putting their journal in
mourning for the dismal intelligence it contained;
some headed the page with a representation
of three gibbets, and a general suspended
from each, cut in wood for the occasion.</p>

<p>What could be done? There were not wanting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
writers who called upon government to annul
the convention. The Romans, they said, would
have done so, and have delivered up the generals
who signed it, bound and haltered, to the enemy’s
discretion. Would it be argued, that to break
the treaty would be to break our faith towards
the enemy? Why, it was so framed that it could
not be fulfilled without breaking our faith towards
each and all of our allies! We were the
allies of Portugal; and it was a breach of faith towards
Portugal, to transport this army of thieves,
ravishers, and murderers out of the country in
which they had perpetrated their crimes, and
from which they had no other possible means of
escape. We were the allies of Spain; and it
was a breach of faith towards Spain, if four-and-twenty
thousand French troops, cut off from all
succour and all retreat, should be conveyed,
under the British flag, into their own country,
with arms and baggage, that they might join the
forces with which Buonaparte was preparing to
march against the Spaniards. We were the allies
of Sweden; and it was a breach of faith towards
Sweden to carry Russian sailors through the
Swedish fleet for the purpose of manning Russian
ships against the Swedes. Were we then to
annul this treaty with our enemies, or to betray
our friends? for to this alternative our triumvirate
of generals had reduced us! No law of nations
could justify them in making such stipulations;
no law of nations therefore could justify us in
performing them. But the French, it was urged,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
had already fulfilled their part of the convention;
they had evacuated the fortified towns,
and admitted us into Lisbon. Thus we had
already reaped the advantages, and were, in honour,
bound to carry into effect the remainder
of the treaty, which was advantageous to them.
In whatever way we acted, some loss of honour
was inevitable; but it was less disgraceful to
break the terms than to fulfil them; better that
the French should reproach us, than that they
should compliment us upon a fidelity which enabled
them to injure our allies. The blow, it
was affirmed, might have gone far towards deciding
the fate of Europe. France had lost one
army in Andalusia, and how deeply Buonaparte
felt the loss was shown by the anxiety with which
he concealed it from the French people. What
might not have been the effect of the destruction
of a second and larger army, following so close
upon that of the former! How would it have
encouraged the Portugueze, given new animation
to the Spaniards, and raised the hope and
the courage of those various states who were
suffering under the tyrant’s yoke!</p>

<p>The conditions which had been granted to the
Russian Admiral were condemned with the same
vehement feeling of disappointment. The intimate
connexion which had so lately subsisted
between the Courts of London and Petersburgh,
and the personal regard which the British Admiral
entertained for Admiral Siniavin, had been
adduced as reasons why an agreement acceptable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
to both nations should be concluded. Certainly
it became us to manifest every mark of personal
respect toward the Russian officers, because,
though the false policy of their government had
engaged the two countries in war, there existed
no angry feelings nor jarring interests between
them; and the wishes of both were for a renewal
of that long established intercourse which was
beneficial to both. It also behoved us especially
to show ourselves grateful for the protection
which the Russians had afforded to the English
and Portugueze refugees, and the facilities which
they had given them of effecting their escape.
These were personal favours, for which the obvious
personal return should have been to have
immediately sent home men and officers under
an engagement not to serve against us or our
allies, and to have shown towards them every
courtesy and kindness by which the evils of hostility
can be mitigated. But that personal regard
should influence the terms of capitulation, was
a thing as unheard of as the terms themselves.
“Hold in deposit!” The phrase had never before
been known in the British navy. They knew
what it was to fight their enemies; they knew
what it was to beat, capture, sink, burn, and destroy
them, according to the spirit and letter of
their instructions. This was said by the navy,
and by the nation; and the bitter reflection arose,
how would Nelson have received such a proposal!</p>

<p>Such language as this arose from a right feeling;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
but the disappointment of well-founded and
high-raised hopes had heated the public mind,
and disqualified it for regarding the whole transaction
dispassionately. The manner in which
the Portugueze had been overlooked in the negotiation
was aggravated in England by persons
who supported the pretensions of the Junta of
Porto; and undue stress was laid upon the neglect
of formalities which could not have been overlooked
if the Portugueze General had been acting
with the British army as he ought. There had
been one serious omission affecting the Portugueze,
which was, in not insisting upon a stipulation
that the troops of that nation who had
been sent to serve in Buonaparte’s armies should
be restored to their own country; such a stipulation
ought to have been required, though it
would undoubtedly have been broken. The other
oversights which were objected were merely frivolous,
and the manner in which, through all the
subsequent details, the feelings as well as interests
of the Portugueze had been consulted, had
already contented them, and made them grateful
for the conduct of their allies. There was another
cause which exasperated the English people:
they compared the treatment of Junot’s army
with that of Dupont’s, and were mortified by a
comparison which ought rather to have elated
them; for looking to what seemed advantageous,
and not to what was just, they did not perceive
that in deferring to a popular cry the Junta of
Seville had broken a solemn engagement. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
strong disapprobation with which Sir Hew Dalrymple
regarded that breach of faith, acted upon
him, perhaps unconsciously, when he allowed
the French the utmost which could be claimed
upon the most liberal construction of the letter
of the treaty in their favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Board of Inquiry appointed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meetings were convened in most parts of England
to express the indignation of the people at
the convention, and call for the punishment of
those by whom it had been negotiated. The
Common Council presented an address to the
same purport, and were told in reply that it was
inconsistent with the principles of British justice
to pronounce judgement without previous investigation,
and that their interposition was not
necessary for inducing the King to institute a due
inquiry into a transaction which had disappointed
the hopes and expectations of the nation. Accordingly
the three Generals were recalled, and
a Board of Inquiry was appointed, composed of
the Earl of Moira, General Craig, Lord Heathfield,
the Earl of Pembroke, Sir George Nugent,
and Lieutenant-General Nicolls, with Sir David
Dundas for president. Their decision, after a
long and full investigation, was, that they could
not pronounce, with confidence, whether the
victory of Vimeiro ought to have been pursued
or not; but, considering the extraordinary circumstances
under which two new commanders
arrived from the ocean, and joined the army, (the
one during, and the other immediately after the
battle, and these successively superseding each<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
other, and both the original commander, within
the space of twenty-four hours,) it was not surprising
that the army was not carried forward
until the second day after the action, from the
necessity of the generals’ being acquainted with
the actual state of things, and proceeding accordingly.
On a consideration of all circumstances,
they were of opinion, that no farther
proceeding was necessary; and, however some of
them might differ respecting the fitness of the
convention, it was their unanimous declaration,
that unquestionable zeal and firmness had been
exhibited by all the three generals.</p>

<p>As this was, in fact, delivering no opinion at
all, the board was called upon, by the Duke of
York, as commander-in-chief, to resume its consideration
of the armistice and convention, and
pronounce decidedly whether they thought them
adviseable. The armistice was disapproved by
Earl Moira; the convention by the same nobleman,
by the Earl of Pembroke, and General Nicolls:
thus, six of the seven members approved
the armistice, and four approved the convention.
The dissentient members delivered in their reasons
for the opinion which they gave. General
Nicolls and Earl Pembroke confined themselves
to a military point of view. Earl Moira took a
wider scope, and argued ably against the moral
and political effects of the treaty. The proceedings

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 18, 1809.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

were concluded by a declaration from the
King, adopting the unanimous opinion of the
board, that no farther proceeding was necessary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
but expressing his disapprobation of those articles
of the convention in which stipulations were
made, directly affecting the interests or feelings
of the Spanish and Portugueze nations. That
disapprobation his Majesty had signified to Sir
Hew Dalrymple when the treaty was first laid
before him, and he repeated it, deeming it necessary
that his sentiments should be clearly
understood, as to the impropriety and danger of
the unauthorised admission, into military conventions,
of articles of such a description. Nor
could he forbear observing, that Sir Hew’s delaying
to transmit the armistice concluded on
the 22d of August, till the 4th of September,
when the ratified convention was transmitted at
the same time, was calculated to produce great
public inconvenience, and that such inconvenience
had, in fact, resulted therefrom. The King
abstained from any observations upon other parts
of the convention.</p>

<p>Thus the whole censure fell upon Sir Hew
Dalrymple. But it was seen by the people that
the great error of judgement had been committed
at home, in not providing that the General by
whom the campaign was planned should carry it
to the end. And how often may it be observed
in history, as in private life, that the course of
events is better directed to the end desired, than
if the persons most interested in the success
could themselves have ordered it! So it was in
this campaign, which at the time so severely disappointed
the nation. A more splendid triumph<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
might have been obtained in the field, a higher
tone might have been taken in the negotiation;
but in either of these cases Almeida and Elvas
would have been left in possession of the enemy;
and whatever efforts might have been made for
reducing them, they could easily have held out
till the dispersion of the Spanish armies. It would
then have been a great object with the French
to relieve the garrisons, and this would have
brought them to Lisbon at a time when there
were neither preparations nor means for resistance
there.</p>

<br /><hr />Necessity of a provisional government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="firstword">When</span> Castaños was informed of Sir Hew Dalrymple’s
appointment to the command of the
British army, he declared that he regarded this
nomination as the most fortunate event of his
own life; so much advantage to the common
cause did he anticipate from their confidence in
each other, and the cordial co-operation which
would ensue. In reality that influence which
the confidence of a British commander would
have given him, might have been of the most
essential benefit to Spain at this momentous
crisis.</p>

<p>Such was the national character, that when the
struggle commenced every man was ready to
follow in the cause of his country; but so pitiable
had been the state of education, and so successfully
had the double despotism of the government
and the inquisition shut out knowledge
from their empire, that no man was fit to lead.
There were now as many governments as there
were Juntas, each acting with little regard to
the others; and as these were every where filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
by persons chosen because of their station, the
government throughout Spain was delivered, or
rather fell into the hands of the provincial nobility
and gentry, with a few clergy; a set of men
whom their general want of information, their
prejudices, and their previous way of life, in
great measure disqualified for the task to which
they were called. Among them were some persons
who had formerly been in office at Madrid;
but whatever advantage they might have derived
from habits of business, was more than counterbalanced
by the dilatory formalities acquired at
the same time, and their attachment to the old
routine with all its defects and evils. Wherever
therefore such statesmen of the old school were
found, the Juntas were less efficient than they
might have been without them. The powers
with which these bodies found themselves invested
were neither limited in extent or duration:
the people in their confidence (which at
such times is as blind as their suspicion) never
thought of proposing restrictions: and the Juntas,
when once in possession of authority, thought
only of making it as extensive, and retaining it
as long as they could. Some of them passed
decrees bestowing upon themselves the titles of
Excellencies and Highnesses, and adopted uniforms
of the gaudiest fashion. This was mere
vanity; but serious injury was done, when, with
as little decency as had been observed under the
old system, they conferred commissions and commands,
not upon those persons who had the fairest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
claim, but upon their own friends and relations
and dependents; and thus, as the enrolment was
general, the armies were filled with officers who
had no other pretensions to rank and promotion
than what they derived from favour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Castaños prevents a contest between Granada and Seville.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>After the great success in Andalusia, the provincial
Juntas, instead of exerting themselves to
the utmost for completing the deliverance of the
country, became jealous of each other. Where
the rival authorities were far distant, this feeling
impeded the public service; greater evils were
threatened when they bordered upon each other.
Granada at this time refused to acknowledge the
supreme authority which the Junta of Seville
assumed, and had hitherto exercised with ability
and good fortune. A warm contention ensued;
and Tilly, either from irritation, or worse motives,
proposed that a division of the Andalusian army
should be sent to enforce submission. Fortunately
Castaños was present at the meeting in
which this proposition was made; he rose from
his seat, and, striking the table, said, he should
like to see the man who dared order a division
of the troops under his command to march without
his authority! He knew no distinction of
provinces; he had the honour to command part
of the army of Spain, and never would he suffer
it to be made the instrument of civil war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Plans for a government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The occasion required, and therefore justified,
this prompt assumption of a power, dangerous
in its kind, and in nowise congenial to the unambitious
temper of Castaños, a man whose only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
desire was to do his duty like a true Spaniard
under any circumstances. It proved, however,
the necessity of establishing a more legitimate
authority than as yet existed. Lord Collingwood,
in his first communications with Seville,
had advised that a general Council, Cortes, or
Congress, should be appointed, and invested with
power from the several provincial Juntas to preside
over and act in the name of the whole. The
necessity of some such arrangement became every
day more apparent. Some persons proposed to
establish a military form of government, in which
that vigour which the emergency required might
be found; some were for assembling a Cortes;
others recommended that a viceroy or lieutenant
of the kingdom should be appointed, and to this
Castaños was at one time inclined. His first
thought before the struggle began had been to
invite the Archduke Charles; but upon considering
that the invitation could not be accepted
while Austria continued at peace with France,
and that if a war between those powers took
place, the Archduke’s services would be required
at home, he then thought the Prince Royal of
the house of Naples would be the fittest person
to hold the regency till the fate of Ferdinand
should be known; and this he proposed to the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrival of a Sicilian Prince at Gibraltar.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Junta. The Sicilian court from the commencement
of the insurrection had directed their views
to the same object: their minister in London
had sounded the disposition of the British Government,
and found it decidedly unfavourable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
to their schemes; and they sent a plenipotentiary
to reside at Gibraltar, for the purpose of furthering
the interests of the family. But Sir Hew
Dalrymple happened to be informed of what had
passed in London, and finding that the object of
this mission was altogether disapproved by the
British Government, and that the agent had
papers which he intended to circulate without
previously communicating their contents to him,
felt it necessary to let him know that his residence
in the garrison, under these circumstances,
might be attended with inconvenience,
and therefore he must return to Palermo for new
instructions. This was about the middle of July;
in the ensuing month, a few days before Sir Hew
left Gibraltar to take the command of the army,
Prince Leopold, second son of the King of the
Two Sicilies, with the Duke of Orleans and a
large retinue, arrived there in a British man of
war. A more ill-judged step could hardly have
been taken. Great Britain had scrupulously
avoided any thing which could have the appearance
of dictating to the Spaniards, or interfering
with them in any other way than that of giving
the most prompt and liberal support; but what
a pretext would it afford those who were ever
ready to malign the measures of England, if at
a time when the Spaniards were deliberating
concerning the settlement of their government,
a Prince who claimed the regency should be received
with royal honours at Gibraltar, and at
the very juncture when a British army arrived<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
upon the coast! Under these embarrassing circumstances
Sir Hew acted with great firmness
and discretion. Persisting in that upright and
steady course of conduct which had in so great
a degree contributed to win the confidence of
the Spanish nation, he refused in any manner to
support pretensions which he had reason to believe
were not approved by his government; to
that government he referred the Duke of Orleans,
who accordingly resolved to go to England, and
make his representations in person; the Prince
was received into Gibraltar, and left there, when
Sir Hew went to the army; if he were chosen
Regent, any deputation duly appointed to announce
that nomination was of course to be admitted,
and considered as attached to his retinue;
but no such deputation from any local or provisional
government was to be received on such
terms.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ambition of the Junta of Seville.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There was at this time a report that the Junta
of Seville had declared for a regency, and were
hesitating between the Archbishop of Toledo,
as the only remaining member of the Bourbon
family in Spain, a Prince of the Neapolitan house,
and the Conde de Montijo, the most intriguing,
and then one of the most popular persons in
Spain. As this individual had no pretensions to
such a charge, except what his undeserved popularity
might give him, the report was probably
raised by himself as one means to bring about
his elevation. Some members of that Junta were
intoxicated with success; a few others cared for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
nothing but their own interest: the latter wished
for a Regent of their own appointment, under
whose name they might possess the real power;
the former were for retaining the authority which
hitherto they had administered well, but which
ceased to be legitimate when it became apparent
that it was retained for ambitious motives. A
paper from the Junta of Murcia, which expressed
the opinion of Florida-Blanca, had forcibly pointed
out the necessity of a central government, and
the inevitable ruin which a polyarchy of independent
Juntas would bring on. It advised that
the cities which had a seat in the Cortes should
elect a council to govern in the name of Ferdinand,
and that the military affairs should be
entrusted to a council of generals. The Junta
of Seville suppressed this paper wherever their
influence extended; but a like measure was now
recommended by an authority with which the
Junta could not cope.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Council of Castille advise a central Junta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Council of Castille had recovered some
of its lost reputation by the tardy resistance
which it opposed to the Intruder, and by exerting
itself with authority to maintain order in the
capital, after the retreat of the French. It published
a justification of its own conduct, more
elaborate than convincing, and dispatched a circular
address to the provincial Juntas, declaring

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

its readiness to co-operate with them in any
plans of defence. With respect to measures of
another kind, it said, which were necessary to
save the country, all that belonged to that Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
was to excite the authority of the nation, and
assist it with its influence, advice, and knowledge.
Under circumstances so extraordinary it was not
possible to adopt at once the measures indicated
by the laws and customs of Spain; the Council
therefore would confine itself to recommending
that deputies should be appointed by all the different
Juntas, who should meet together, and, in
union with it, confer and determine upon this
important object; so that all provisions proceeding
from this common centre might be as expeditious
as the end required.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Project of the Junta of Seville.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The better spirits in the Junta of Seville prevailed
on this occasion, and that body, yielding
with a good grace to the general opinion, seemed
at the same time to direct it. They published
an address, written with the ability which distinguished
all their public papers. Hitherto,
they said, the cause of the Spaniards had been
prosperous, and nothing could frustrate their
hopes of success, except a want of union among
themselves. Their enemies were anxious to
foment divisions. Human passions, personal interests
ill understood, the ignorance, the weakness,
the blindness of men, might assist these
evil designs, destroy a beginning so glorious, and
facilitate the ruin of Spain. This they were endeavouring
to guard against, protesting, before
God and man, that they wrote nothing but what
was dictated by the love of their country, being
ready to hear the opinions of other provinces,
and to amend their own errors, whenever it should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
be shown that they had committed any. The
chief care should be to avoid whatever might
serve to sow disunion: of this nature were all
discussions concerning the royal house, and the
order of succession in the different families which
derived a right from it. The laws upon this
point were well known; but are we, said they,
in a situation to talk of this? Long live King
Ferdinand VII. and his august brothers, heirs
of the crown after his attested decease! Why
anticipate inquiries which could only be necessary
in default of them?</p>

<p>The second question which agitated the people
was of a different nature: ... Was there a necessity
for creating a supreme government, which should
unite the sovereign authority of all the provinces,
till the restitution of Ferdinand to his throne?
From the beginning they had been persuaded
such a government was by all means necessary.
Many Juntas and many military commanders
had expressed their conviction of this truth, ...
a conviction arising from the necessity in every
nation of a civil government, to which the
military may be subordinate. Spain, deriving
wisdom from history, had never thought of appointing
a dictator. Her generals (and the fact
was most honourable to the Spanish name) had
been the first to acknowledge a system of things
as ancient in Spain as the monarchy itself. The
confidence of the people in the Supreme Juntas,
the abundance with which pecuniary resources
had been placed at their disposal, the heroic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
loyalty wherewith the army had obeyed them,
and the happy issue, thus far, of their civil
administration, and of the military enterprises
which they had directed, placed in the most
conspicuous light, and established, beyond all
doubt, this fundamental truth, and most essential
political principle. But who was to create this
supreme civil government? Who were to compose
it? Where should be its place of residence?
What the extent of its authority? How might
it be established, without producing disunion
among the different provinces? These were the
important questions to be examined.</p>

<p>It had been said that the Cortes ought to
assemble, that the Council of Castille should
convoke them, and the whole proceedings be
executed under the authority of that tribunal.
But the Council of Castille never possessed the
right of convoking the Cortes, ... why then should
they give it that authority? Was it because it
had lent the whole weight of its influence to the
usurpation? Because it had acted in opposition to
those fundamental laws which it was established
to preserve and defend? Because it had afforded
the enemy every facility to usurp the sovereignty
of Spain, to destroy the hereditary succession of
the crown, and the dynasty legally in possession?
Because it had recognized and seated on the
throne a foreigner, destitute even of the shadow
of a title to it? What confidence could the Spanish
nation place in a government convoked by an
authority incompetent, illegal, and guilty of acts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
which might justly be ranked with the most
atrocious crimes against their country? But the
Council of Castille being thus excluded from all
consideration, who was to convoke the Cortes?
It was the peculiar and exclusive prerogative of
the King to summon them; the provinces would
not submit to any other authority; they would not
unite: thus, therefore, there would be no Cortes,
or, if a few deputies were to assemble, that very
circumstance would occasion divisions, the very
evil which all were anxious to avoid. The kingdom
found itself suddenly without a king and
without a government, ... a situation unknown
in its history, and to its laws. The people legally
resumed the power of appointing a government.
They created Juntas without any regard to the
cities which had votes in the Cortes. The legitimate
power was therefore deposited with the
Juntas: in virtue of that power they had governed,
and still were governing, and had been,
and still were, universally acknowledged and
obeyed. Their situation had not changed; the
danger still existed; no new authority had supervened:
the lawful authority resided entire in the
Juntas to which the people had confided it. It
was therefore incontestable that the sole and exclusive
right of electing those who were to compose
the supreme government was vested in the
supreme Juntas. And whom should they elect?
Most certainly individuals of their own body;
for they alone derived their power from the
people, and in them the nation had reposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
entire confidence. Hence, if there were any
province in which the military power subsisted
alone, it was absolutely necessary that a supreme
Junta should be constituted there, by which the
people might act; this being indispensable, in
order to concentrate the legitimate power of the
people; for, under present circumstances, the
government could not be legitimate, unless it
originated in their free consent.</p>

<p>The Junta of Seville was therefore of opinion
that the supreme Juntas, meeting on the same
day, should each elect, from its own members,
two deputies; and the persons so elected, from
that moment, be acknowledged as governors-general
of the kingdom. The supreme Juntas
ought nevertheless to be continued till the termination
of the present state of things, being
invested with the internal management of their
respective provinces, but under due subordination
to the general government. They ought to
give instructions to their deputies constituting
that government, and it would be the duty of
those deputies to observe them, and to represent
and support the claims of their provinces, as far
as was consistent with the public weal. If there
were one of the Royal Family capable of presiding
in the supreme government, he, and no
other, ought to be appointed to that office; but
if there were no person of the royal blood, then
it must elect a president from its own body; and,
to obviate all danger, the presidency should be
only for such limited time as might seem best.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
The Juntas would appoint a place for the seat
of government, which the government might
afterwards change, if it should see cause. It
ought to be at a distance from the dangers of
war, and to possess other local advantages. Seville
possessed those advantages, but had no anxiety
to be selected, and willingly sacrificed her claims.
The Junta of that city would, however, frankly
state, that, in their opinion, La Mancha was most
convenient for the seat of government, and, especially,
either the city of Ciudad-Real, or Almagro.
But this point was to be decided by the free
choice of the supreme Juntas. The paper concluded
with a brief and dignified recapitulation
of what the Junta of Seville had done for their
country, disclaiming, on their part, any affectation
or desire of superiority, and declaring, that
whatever they had done was no more than their
indispensable duty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Provincial Juntas assent to it.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The general opinion was undoubtedly in favour
of the plan of government thus recommended;
and it is no light proof of its fitness, that schemes
the same in principle and effect should have been
suggested by persons who had no communication
with each other, and whose views were in other
respects so different. There were many in England
who thought it would have been better to
have at once convoked the Cortes, in the supposition
that there was more resemblance between
the Cortes and the English parliament
than had ever really existed, and in the generous
but mistaken hope that vigorous measures might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
be expected from a free legislative assembly. The
best and wisest of the Spaniards wished also for
a Cortes, and looked to it for such judicious reforms
as were conformable to the constitutional
principles of the monarchy, and suited to the
habits and feelings of the nation. But they saw
that many points must be determined before the
manner of assembling the Cortes could be adjusted,
and that the necessity of forming a central
government was immediate and urgent. The plan
therefore which the Junta of Seville proposed was
assented to without opposition. Still it was a great
object with many of the provincial Juntas to retain
their power. That of Valencia drew up secret
rules for its deputies, declaring that they were to
follow the direction of their constituents, remain
subject and obedient to them, communicate regularly
with them, and in no instance depart
from their instructions; and they reserved to
themselves the power of displacing their deputies
at pleasure. This paper was made public; and
it was known that other Juntas, that of Seville
in particular, had pursued the same mischievous
course.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Unworthy choice of the Junta of Seville.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Junta of Seville, however, did worse than
this. In electing its deputies it chose two persons
so notoriously unworthy of such a trust,
that the only motives which could be assigned for
the choice were a desire of being rid of them, or
an opinion that they would submit to any terms
for the sake of the appointment. D. Vicente
Hore was the one; he had been a creature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Godoy’s, and was so sensible of the estimation in
which he was held, that he declined the charge,
knowing his life would be in danger if he appeared
in Madrid, where it was of course expected
that the Central Junta would assemble.
D. Juan de Vera y Delgado, titular Archbishop
of Laodicea, the coadjutor of Seville, was then
chosen in his place; and this was an unexceptionable
choice. It was hoped and expected that
Tilly, the other member, would follow Hore’s
example, in declining an appointment for which
he was equally disqualified; but Tilly was of a
bolder stamp. A blasted character had not prevented
him from obtaining great popularity at
Seville; and being utterly regardless of the means
by which he brought about his ends, he was ready
to venture for the highest stake in the game of
revolution. Foul facts had been proved against
him, and fouler were, upon no light grounds,
imputed. He had found it necessary to fly from
Madrid before the troubles, because he was implicated
in the robbery of a jeweller. The murder
of the Conde de Aguila was attributed to him,
because it was certain that he might have saved
the Count by the slightest interference in his
behalf. A wretch who was notoriously his creature
had been one of the most active instruments
in Solano’s death; and Reding would have been
made away with by his means before the battle
of Baylen, if the intention had not been disclosed
to Castaños, and by him prevented.</p>

<p>This appointment was not perhaps what Tilly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
would have chosen; for it was believed that he
had no inclination to show himself at Madrid;
but he trusted to his talents for intrigue, obtained
a monthly allowance of 500 dollars, and looked

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The other members unexceptionable.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

for those opportunities which revolutionary times
offer to insane and desperate ambition. It is to
the honour of the Spaniards, that this was the
only exceptionable person elected for the central
Junta: perhaps in no country could an equal
number of men, under similar circumstances,
have been chosen more worthy of the trust reposed
in them. To be elected to a situation of
so great responsibility, in a time of unexampled
difficulties, was no object of desire; in no instance
was the appointment solicited, and in most
it was reluctantly accepted. The persons deputed
were thirty-five<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> in number; of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Florida-Blanca and Jovellanos were the most remarkable,
for the offices which they had formerly
filled, and the rank which they held in public
opinion. Both were scholars as well as statesmen,
both men of business, both high-minded
and honourable Spaniards. Florida-Blanca had
more of the spirit of his country, Jovellanos was
more influenced by that of the age. The former
had been an ambitious politician; the latter was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
always a philosopher, in the true and virtuous
meaning of that polluted word. As the despotic
minister of an absolute king, Florida-Blanca had
used his power vigorously to uphold the dignity
of the kingdom, and improve its internal condition;
most of his measures were wise, and all
were well-intended; but if he had ever conceived
a wish to correct the abuses of the state, it had
never appeared in his actions: Jovellanos had
unwillingly accepted office, because it placed him
in a sphere uncongenial to his modest habits and
better mind, and withdrew him from the task to
which he had devoted himself, of improving his
native province. Jovellanos’s desire was to meliorate
the government and the nation by recurring
to the free principles of the old constitution;
Florida-Blanca thought that if governments were
administered as they ought to be, the strongest
must be the best. Both, without hesitation<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a>,
obeyed the call of their country, though Florida-Blanca,
who was in extreme old age, would more
willingly have passed the short remainder of his
days in preparing and waiting for death; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
Jovellanos, broken down, more by the infirmities
which an unjust and cruel imprisonment had
aggravated or induced, than by the weight of
sixty-five years, desired for himself nothing in
this world but tranquillity. The former brought
with him little more than a venerable name; but
Jovellanos was in full possession of his intellectual
powers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos refuses all offers of the Intrusive Government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Every effort had been made by Azanza, O’Farril,
Urquijo, Mazarredo, and Cabarrus, to engage
this excellent man in the Intruder’s service. He
had lived in habits of friendship with all these
persons, more especially with the two last. Knowing
how inaccessible he would be to all unworthy
inducements, they endeavoured to deceive him,
as they would fain have deceived themselves,
by representing that theirs was the only course
which could secure the welfare of Spain; and
that by no other means could the calamities with
which it was threatened be averted; for they
thought it absurd to imagine any effectual resistance
could be opposed to the determined ambition
of Buonaparte. His reply was, that if the
cause of their country were as desperate as they
supposed it to be, still it was the cause of honour
and loyalty, and that which a good Spaniard ought
to follow at all hazards. Jovellanos held with his
favourite author Cicero that friendship was to be
preferred to every thing except honour and virtue;
he had given proof of this by his former
conduct toward some of these friends, and they
found now, as they had then, that no considerations<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
could ever prevail in him over the sense of
duty. It gave him no little pain that his name
should be published in the Madrid gazette as one
of Joseph’s ministers; thus to appear a traitor
even for a few days to those who knew him not,
or knew not how decidedly he had refused the appointment,
was an injury which he felt severely.
This was one of Buonaparte’s insolent acts; fallen
as Urquijo and his colleagues were, they would
not have thus outraged the feelings of a man
whom it was not possible that they could ever
cease to respect and admire. At length, the Intrusive
Government having ascertained that he
was really suffering under severe bodily infirmities,
forbore to molest him with further solicitations.
He was gradually recovering when news
of the battle of Baylen refreshed his heart, and
seemed to give him new life as well as hope.
And when his appointment to the Central Junta
was announced, though his first thought was of
the ravages which age and affliction had made
upon his debilitated frame, the sense of duty

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos a sus Compatriotas, p. ii. art. i. 18–25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

overcame all personal considerations, and he notified
his acceptation without delay, at the same
time declining a salary of 4000 ducats which had
been assigned him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Aranjuez chosen for the place of meeting.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In little more than a week he joined the deputies
for Aragon, Catalonia, and Valencia, at
Madrid; and then two difficulties, which had not
been anticipated, occurred. The first related to
the instructions with which the Junta of Seville
had fettered their members; instructions wholly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
repugnant to the principle upon which the provisional
government was formed. The inconsistency
and the evils of this measure were represented
to Castaños, who was then in Madrid
with his army; that General’s influence was never
exercised unworthily, nor withheld when it might
be useful; and in consequence of his remonstrance
the obnoxious instructions were withdrawn,
though it appeared afterwards that secret
ones to the same tenour had been substituted.
The other difficulty was concerning the place of
meeting. Jovellanos thought that no place could
be so proper as the metropolis: there, in the
palace of their kings, the Central Junta would
derive consequence and respect from the place;
they would appear at the head of the first tribunals
and chief magistracy; the public documents were
upon the spot, and any advice or assistance which
they might require at hand. The members who
were at Madrid agreed in this opinion, which was
supported also by Castaños: but the Junta of
Seville were averse to any measure which might
lessen their authority, and in this instance they
were well served by Tilly for reasons which nearly
concerned himself. He had stopped at Aranjuez,
and succeeded in persuading Florida-Blanca, who
was decidedly for fixing the government at Madrid,
that it would be convenient to hold their
first sittings where they were, and determine
there upon the forms which they should observe
in the capital. He gained time by this ... always
a great object for one who trusts to intrigue and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
fortune. So fully persuaded however were Jovellanos
and his colleagues when they went to
Aranjuez that they should speedily adjourn to
Madrid, that they left orders for forming an
establishment there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Installation of the Central Junta. <span class="date">Sept. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The greater part of the deputies having arrived,
their installation was performed with as much
ceremony as the place and circumstances would
permit. The Archbishop of Laodicea performed
mass, and administered an oath to his colleagues,
first taking it himself, that they would preserve
and extend the holy, Catholic, Apostolic, and
Roman religion, defend their Sovereign Ferdinand,
their rights, privileges, laws, and usages,
and especially those relating to the succession
in the reigning family, promote every thing conducive
to the welfare and improvement of the
kingdom, keep secret every thing which ought
not to be divulged, maintain the laws, and resist the
enemies of the country at all hazards. The oath
having been taken, Te Deum was sung by the
barefooted friars of St. Pasqual, and the assembly
then adjourned to the hall chosen for their sittings.
Florida-Blanca was appointed president,
and his first act was to proclaim King Ferdinand
from the great gallery of the principal front of
the palace. The gates of the palace had not
been opened till now since the departure of
Charles for Bayonne; and the ceremony of thus
proclaiming Ferdinand in the favourite residence
of his ancestors, ... the scene of his own childhood,
... the spot where, six months ago, he had
been acclaimed King, ... he who was now prisoner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
in a foreign land, and in the power of the perfidious
tyrant who had ensnared him, ... moved
the venerable statesman to tears when he pronounced
his name, and excited feelings of grief
and indignation in the multitude, which heightened
and hallowed the enthusiasm wherewith
they repeated it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Conduct of the Council of Castille.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Junta dispatched copies of the act and
oath of installation to the different councils and
tribunals, requiring their members to take the
same oath, and issue orders to all the subordinate
Juntas, provinces, magistrates, governors, and
viceroys, for obeying the new government, as
holding in deposit the sovereign authority for
Ferdinand, the councils continuing in the exercise
of their ordinary functions, but referring to
the Central Junta all matters exceeding their
powers, and upon which the Sovereign ought
to be consulted. Other tribunals immediately
signified their prompt and unreserved obedience;
the Council of Castille alone delayed their answer.
The mortification which they felt at not
being incorporated with the provisional government,
as they had proposed, was embittered by
a consciousness that they had forfeited all claim
to the confidence of the nation. Having, however,
almost by accident, recovered so much
authority, they strove to extend it, and after five
days returned an answer, saying that, having
given the subject their most serious consideration,
they had resolved to take the oath, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
circulate the necessary orders that the Central
Junta should be obeyed in whatever was for the
service of the King and of the public cause.
But they added, that in discharge of their indispensable
duty, they would hereafter communicate
to the Junta the result of their consultations
for the observance and maintenance of the laws.
The reservation implied in this reply offended
the Junta, and more especially the President
Florida-Blanca, who had not been accustomed
to tolerate delay or demur under his administration;
and an answer was returned conveying reproof
in the form of admonition, which reduced
the Council of Castille to a quiet but malevolent
submission.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Leonese deputies arrested by Cuesta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Leonese deputies had been seized by
General Cuesta on their way. One of them, the
Bayley Valdes, notified his arrest to Florida-Blanca,
who instantly perceiving what fatal consequences
must arise from any serious dispute
between the civil and military authorities, wrote
mildly to Cuesta, requesting that he would release
the deputies, prefer his charges against
them to the Junta, and leave the decision to that
body. At the same time Castaños, to whom the
judicious part of the people in Madrid looked
for some interference in their fear at this unexpected
act of military violence, addressed a
letter to the Castillian general, representing to
him calmly, but forcibly, the surprise and alarm
which this arrest had occasioned, at a time when
the great object of forming a provisional government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
was on the point of being happily effected;
and asking what offence the deputies had committed,
men as they were of high character, and
the Bayley Valdes distinguished for the services
which he had performed? what authority was
competent to arrest and detain them? why, if
they were delinquents, they had not been denounced
to the Juntas of their respective provinces?
why their crimes were not published in
the face of the nation, and themselves accused
before the Central Junta, then about to assemble?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cuesta’s vindication of his conduct.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In his answer to Castaños, Cuesta declared,
that as principal and sole chief of the provinces
of Castille and Leon, he was not bound to give
an account of his conduct to any other provincial
authority, being independent of all till a general
government or regency should be established;
nevertheless, as his Excellency apprehended some
uneasiness in the people of Madrid, and in the
whole nation, concerning this transaction, he
deemed it proper to satisfy his doubts. The
Junta of Castille having been dissolved by the
entrance of the enemy into Valladolid, he had
increased the Junta of Leon by adding to it a
deputy for every intendency or province of Castille,
and had confirmed Valdes as their president,
Valdes having promised to obey his orders in all
things, without consideration of his own rank.
But after the battle of Rio Seco, a few members
of this Junta, seeing him pursued by the French,
and forsaken by the Galician army, retired to
Ponferrada, instead of Astorga, whither he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
directed them to repair: and there, under the
influence of Valdes, treated clandestinely with
the Junta of Coruña, to unite with them at Lugo,
and from thence govern both Castille and Leon,
independently of the captain-general, who, indeed,
was to become subordinate to them. The Bayley
had notified this to him, and at the same time
ordered him to deliver up his cavalry to General
Blake. Instead of obeying such orders, he had
immediately annulled this fugitive Junta, and
commanded the inferior Juntas to break off all
communication with it, which they had accordingly
done, except in those parts of Leon which
were under the immediate power of the Galician
general. The fugitive Junta persisted in its pretensions,
and had elected Valdes and the Vizconde
de Quintanilla as its representatives in the
Central Junta. Let any impartial person then
say whether he had not good reason to arrest
them for insubordination! Not having been
elected by any competent authority, they were
not members of the Central Junta, and therefore
no offence had been offered to that body in arresting
them. Whenever that body should be assembled,
he would be the first person to obey it,
and submit to its high consideration the cause
of Valdes and his accomplices: till then neither
the rank of the Bayley, nor his assumed quality
of member of the Central Junta, for the provinces
of Castille and Leon, shall suffice, said the old
General, to exempt him from my jurisdiction.
The same answer he returned to Florida-Blanca,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
and sent back the letter which that nobleman
had addressed to Valdes, saying that the prisoner
was in strict confinement, deprived of all communication.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Council of Castille interfere.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Castaños, not receiving a reply as soon as he
had expected, called upon the Council of Castille
to interfere; and that tribunal, well pleased that
its authority should be appealed to on so important
an occasion in such times, wrote in consequence
to Cuesta, remonstrating on the dangerous
tendency of his conduct. But he returned
for answer, that the imprisonment of these persons
was the best means of preventing danger,
as it would effectually preclude the contentions
which might arise if a double set of representatives
for Castille and Leon should present themselves;
that neither prudence nor justice permitted
him to overlook the infidelity, insurrection,
and insubordination of a Junta which he
had created; and that for these offences, as Valdes
was a general, he would deliver him over to be
tried by a council of war, composed of generals,
unless a sovereign regency should first be established;
in which case he would submit the
whole proceeding to their judgement, and his
own powers also, ... powers which till then he
considered independent of any other authority.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cuesta is summoned before the Central Junta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Upon this principle, and an assumption that
the Juntas in Castille and Leon derived their
authority from him and not from the people,
Cuesta made the Junta of Valladolid, who had
assembled in Leon, send a representative to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Central Junta. The assembly refused to admit
him, and ordering Cuesta to set his prisoners at
liberty, summoned him also to Aranjuez, that all
parties might be heard. This was in effect removing
him from the command of his army.
Such an assertion of their power was well-timed,
for Cuesta, making no secret of his hostile intentions
against them, had declared to the British
agent, Mr. Stuart, that two measures were necessary
for the public good; first, the restoration
of the authority of the Captains General and of
the Royal Audiences, (which would have ensured
to him the continuance of his command); and,
secondly, the exercise of military influence over
the Junta, to make them elect an Executive
Council, of three or five members, each of whom
should be placed at the head of one branch of
the government, and responsible to the nation
only. But Cuesta, intemperate as he was, sincerely
desired to serve his country; and he
obeyed the summons without hesitation. Mutual
accusations were made. The Junta of Leon
reproached the General with his attempts to
maintain order at the commencement of the insurrection,
and thereby serving the Intrusive Government.
They injured themselves more than
Cuesta by this disingenuous attack; for his defence
upon that point was full and satisfactory:
what persons in authority were there throughout
Spain, he asked, who had not endeavoured to
suppress the first popular movement, knowing
how great a force the enemy had in the heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
the country, ready to act any where, and not
knowing that the spirit of resistance was universal?
As soon as that spirit was fairly manifested,
he had taken the national side, had brought
armies into the field, and had done his duty faithfully,
if not fortunately. It was base indeed in
the Junta to bring against him this accusation,
which, if it had been taken up by the populace,
or his own soldiers, might so easily have occasioned
his murder. On the other hand, it was
found, that in the affair of the deputies Cuesta’s
conduct had not been distinguished by that honest
obstinacy which appeared in his own account,
and which characterised his general conduct.
He had not disapproved of the Junta’s
measures till they ordered him to send his cavalry
to Blake, a measure which all the military
men in Madrid considered of the utmost importance
at the time. His opinion of the Bayley
Valdes had been so favourable, that he had made
known his intention to have him elected as his
own colleague; and the immediate cause of this
rash and intemperate proceeding was anger that
he himself had not been chosen. So completely
had this feeling mastered him, that instead of
advancing with his army to Burgo del Osma, (as
had been resolved in a council of war at Madrid
at which he was present,) he had actually fallen
back to Segovia to gratify his resentment by
seizing Valdes. Valdes would now have terminated
the dispute by giving in his resignation:
this it was not thought proper to accept; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
validity of his election was admitted, and the
other points were referred to a competent tribunal,
but the course of events soon put an end
to all further proceedings.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Declaration of the Central Junta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Central Junta, thus peaceably established,
and unanimously recognized by the nation, began
their administration with the fairest promises.
They acknowledged the national debt, and took
upon themselves the obligations contracted by
the crown, which formed the patrimony of many
families; and which they pledged themselves
punctually to pay. That portion of the revenue
which had formerly been swallowed up in the
enormous expenses of the royal household, or
engrossed by the favourite, would, they trusted,
enable them to diminish the imposts laid upon
the towns and villages; and great resources would
be found in the property forfeited by those who
had betrayed their country. The sum total of
the funds arising from these sources, from the
regular revenues, and from the donatives and
contributions of Spain and the Indies, they promised
annually to publish, with an account of its
expenditure. They would simplify, as far as possible,
the revenue system, gradually suppress useless
offices, establish economy in all the branches
of financial administration, and remove the abuses
introduced into it by the old government.</p>

<p>The duties which they proposed to themselves,
and the benefits which they promised the people,
were farther explained in an address to the nation;
for they affirmed, it became them to inform<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
the people of their situation, with a dignity becoming
the Spanish character; and to establish,
in a frank and generous manner, those relations
of reciprocal confidence which ought to be the
basis of every just and wise administration. A
tyranny of twenty years, exercised by the most
incapable hands, had brought them to the very
brink of perdition: the nation was alienated from
its government by hatred or contempt: every
thing favoured the perfidious plot which Buonaparte
had formed against them, when they rose
to vindicate their rights, and became at once the
admiration of Europe. Their situation was unexampled
in their history, unforeseen by their
laws, and, as it were, opposed to their habits.
Great and wonderful things they had accomplished;
but all their enthusiasm and all their
virtue were required for what remained to be
done. Their armies were naked and unprovided
with every thing. The French, collected behind
the Ebro, were expecting reinforcements, and
ravaging Upper Castille, Rioja, and the provinces
of Biscay; Navarre and Catalonia were
almost wholly in their power: they possessed
the passes, and had made themselves, by what
treachery was well known, masters of the strong
frontier fortresses, and of Barcelona. The despot
of France, deceiving, by the grossest impostures,
the slaves who obeyed him, was striving to keep
all other states in inactivity, that he might bring
the whole enormous weight of his military force
upon Spain. The continental powers were watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
the issue of this first struggle, desiring to declare
themselves against the common enemy, but
proceeding with the timid circumspection which
they had learnt from past misfortunes. A confederacy
against the tyrant was evidently their
only means of preservation: for what state could
now hold relations of amity with him? who could
now give credit to the words and promises of
Buonaparte, or trust to his good faith? The fate
of Spain was at once a lesson and a warning to
Europe, ... her resolution would serve as an example,
her victories as an incentive; and the
reprobate, who had trampled under foot the principles
of justice, had placed himself in that fearful
situation, that he must either become master
of all, or perish in the struggle which he had so
wantonly provoked.</p>

<p>But this co-operation would not be obtained till
the Spaniards had given such earnest of success
as rendered victory certain: they must therefore
call forth all their means, as if they were singly
to contend against the whole power of France.
The Junta believed it would be necessary to
maintain 500,000 men in arms, besides 50,000
cavalry, ... a force which, however disproportionate
to their present situation, and to all former
exigencies, was not more than the present
times required. The power of their adversary
was colossal, his ambition even greater than his
power, and his existence incompatible with their
liberty. His exertions were to be estimated by
the barbarity of his character and the extremity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
of his danger; but they were the exertions of a
tyrant, and would be confounded, when opposed
to the constancy of a great and free people.</p>

<p>The last government ... if that might be called
government which was one continued and monstrous
dilapidation, had exhausted all the sources
of prosperity. The resources which arose from
the revenues of the royal household, from the
enormous sums formerly devoured by the insatiable
avarice of Godoy, from his collected rapine,
and the confiscated estates, from a free
trade, a well-arranged administration of the revenue,
and regularly distributed contributions,
had already been indicated. The succours already
given so generously by England, and still
to be expected from that nation, were to be added
to these means. “But,” said the Central Junta,
“it is incumbent on us that these succours, which
have been so opportunely given, and so gratefully
received, and the effects of which have been
so beneficial, should be hereafter recognized and
recompensed with the reciprocity and decorum
which become a great and powerful nation. The
Spanish monarchy must not, in this respect, be
placed in a state of inequality and dependence
on its allies. The produce of these various means
would be great but slow, and therefore insufficient
for the urgent necessities of the state. Would
they be sufficient to furnish for a time the ordinary
supplies, discharge the great debt which
must be incurred, and maintain the formidable
army which must be kept up? If not, the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
would at once have recourse to the
nation, certain, from the fidelity with which its
accounts would regularly be published, from the
necessity and notoriety of the public wants, and
the patriotism of the nation, that although to
evils so extraordinary as the present remedies as
extraordinary must be applied, its demands would
neither be disregarded through distrust, nor detested
as arbitrary.</p>

<p>“The defence of the kingdom, and the means
of providing for it, must necessarily be the first
duty of the government; but it would fulfil only
half its duties if it attended to this alone: other
duties remained, to be the great reward of the
virtue of the Spaniards and of their sacrifices. A
little time only had passed since, oppressed and
degraded, ignorant of their own strength, and
finding no protection against these evils, neither
in the institutions nor in the laws, they had even
regarded foreign dominion as less hateful than
the wasting tyranny which consumed them. The
dominion of a will always capricious, and most
often unjust, had lasted too long: their patience,
their love of order, their generous loyalty had
too long been abused: it was time that law,
founded on general utility, should commence
its reign. This was the desire of their good
and unfortunate King Ferdinand; this was what
he pointed out, even from the captivity to which
a perfidious traitor had reduced him. The name
of their country ought no longer to be a vague
and idle word to the Spaniards; henceforward it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
was to import to their ears and to their hearts
the sanctuary of laws, the theatre for talents, the
reward of virtue. Such a country the Junta solemnly
promised they should possess; and till
the military operations, which must at first be
slow, in order better to insure success, should
furnish the leisure necessary for this great and
solemn reform, the government would privately
prepare for it. Instead of rejecting the advice
of enlightened men, they desired and requested
it. The knowledge and illustration of their ancient
and constitutional laws; the changes which
change of circumstances rendered necessary in
their re-establishment; the reform which might
be necessary in the civil, criminal, and commercial
codes; projects for improving public education,
which was in Spain so greatly on the decline;
a system of regulated economy for the
distribution and collection of the public revenue,
... these were subjects for the investigation of wise
and thoughtful men, and on which the opinions
of such men were solicited. The Junta would
form different committees, each entrusted with
a particular department, to whom all writings on
matters of government and administration might
be addressed: so that each contributing by his
exertions to give a just direction to the public
mind, the government might be enabled to establish
the internal happiness of Spain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos proposes a Regency, and that a Cortes be summoned.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These were fair professions; nor were the intentions
of the Central Junta less laudable than
their language. Tilly alone excepted, the members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
were upright and honourable men, worthy
to represent a nation distinguished for its high
sense of honour. But they were unacquainted
with each other, and except the President,
Jovellanos, and Garay, wholly unused to business:
for a national assembly too few, and for
an executive government too many. Jovellanos
was of opinion that they ought immediately to
appoint a regency of five persons, one of them
being a dignitary of the church, to be installed
on the first day of the ensuing year: that the
Central Junta should then be reduced to half its
original number, retaining one member only of
each deputation, for the purpose of watching over
the observance of the constitution entrusted to
the regency, and corresponding with the provincial
Juntas, which should thenceforward consist
of four members each: these were to exist
as long as the Council of Regency; and the
Central Junta of Correspondence, as it was
then to be called, only till the meeting of the
Cortes, which Jovellanos maintained ought immediately
to be announced as to assemble as
soon as the enemy should have been driven out
of Spain, or, at all events, in two years from
the present time, if the delivery of the country
should not be accomplished before. He proposed
also that the Junta, before it resigned its
powers, should appoint persons qualified for
such a task to prepare plans of reform in the
constitution, laws, finance, system of public instruction,
army, and marine; ... these plans were
to be formed under the inspection and approbation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
of the Council of Regency and the Junta
of Correspondence, and finally submitted to the
Cortes.

<span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />October.</span><span class="sne">♦</span>

In delivering this advice, Jovellanos,
to remove all suspicion of any interested views,
repeated in writing the solemn declaration which
he had before made by word of mouth, that he
never would accept of any office or employment
himself; the natural and invincible repugnance
which he had ever felt for such preferment, the
bitter price which he had paid for having once
accepted it, in deference to a brother whom he
respected like a parent, and the sad sense of
decay both in his physical and moral powers,
determined him to this resolution. The only
duty which he would undertake to perform was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos Memoria, p. ii. § 33, 34. Appendices, No. 5.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the noble one of simply delivering those opinions
which he thought most conducive to the good of
his country, in discharge of the high trust wherewith
his own province had honoured him.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Expectations from a Cortes.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Jovellanos expected the greatest benefit from a
Cortes; but he apprehended great evil if it were
hastily convoked, and without due preparation.
That party who have since assumed the appellation
of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Liberales</i> censured him for proposing to
postpone it so long. They were then a very small,
but active, minority, consisting chiefly of physicians,
lawyers, and unbelieving priests, whose
little knowledge, exclusively derived from prohibited
French books, was worse than ignorance.
These persons were for hurrying on to a jacobinical
revolution, and were impatient for a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Cortes as the first great means of embodying
that democracy which they expected to govern.
But there were also many of the best of the
Spaniards who looked to the Cortes as the surest
means of delivering their country, and restoring
it to its former dignity and power; and the same
views were very generally entertained in England,
and by the British Government itself. In
fact, the assembling of a Cortes had been proposed
by our first authorized agent, Mr. Stuart,
to the Juntas of Galicia and Asturias. Some of
the difficulties which would attend it were then
perceived; the Asturians proposed that it should
assemble at Oviedo, the Galicians at Villa Franca
in the Bierzo, each Junta wishing that it should
be convoked near their own place of abode; and
for the purpose of retaining their power, they
wished to enlarge the deputation, so that all their
own members might be included. Though it was
thus seen that the measure was not so easily accomplished
as had been supposed, still the opinion
prevailed in England, that if a free legislative
assembly were established in Spain, the same
blessings would ensue as the British people enjoy
under the well-tempered constitution which has
grown with their growth, and adapted itself to
their circumstances. There are errors from which
it is painful to be undeceived. Those persons
were wiser in their generation, who, having the
recent example of France before their eyes, believed
that legislative assemblies, in countries
unaccustomed to such modes of legislation, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
more to be dreaded than desired; that the reformation
which is thus begun tends to certain
anarchy; and that where great and extensive improvements
in the existing system are necessary,
the only means whereby they can be effected,
without inducing worse evils than those which
are removed, is by an upright and far-sighted
minister, under a strong government. Upon

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Florida-Blanco averse to it.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

this point Florida-Blanca judged more truly
than Jovellanos. Such, however, was the respect
with which the opinions of that admirable
man were at this time heard, that his proposal
would have been carried, if the Junta had come

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos Memoria, p. ii. § 35.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to an immediate decision upon it; and it was
only by deferring the final discussion till Nov. 7,
being that day month, that the minority averted a
measure which shocked their prejudices as much
as it alarmed their fears.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Junta were at this time full of hope; they
had just confidence in the national character; and
they were elated by the enthusiastic spirit which
had manifested itself, the splendid successes which
had been obtained, the apparent inactivity of the
enemy, and the promised co-operation of Great
Britain, which had already effected the delivery
of Portugal. They had also encouraging advices
from Catalonia. After relieving Figueras, the
French dispatched a force from that fortress to
get possession of Rosas, but failed in the attempt.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">July 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Ill armed, and worse disciplined as they
were, the Catalans displayed that unconquerable
spirit which in all ages has distinguished them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />July.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In no other province were such great and continued
exertions made against the invaders: and
in no other province were the people left so entirely
to their own resources. They made the
most urgent solicitations to the Junta of Seville
for a supply of artillery, which could have been
spared in abundance from the arsenals of Seville
and Cadiz, and which Lord Collingwood offered
them the means of conveying; but they could
obtain none, and were fain, therefore, to use the
trunks of trees, bored, and hooped with iron. The
want of cavalry was even more severely felt in all
the level part of the country; ... no substitute could
be found for this, nor was it possible that their
volunteers and newly-raised levies could resist the
well-disciplined horse-soldiers upon plain ground.
They had, however, been eminently successful
where the ground favoured them; and confiding
in their numbers, they occupied the right bank
of the Llobregat from San Boy to Martorell, in
order to distress the enemy in Barcelona. From
thence they were dislodged by General Lechi,
who, marching out by night with 2500 men,
forded the river in several places at daybreak,
drove them from their batteries, sacked the towns
and villages along the line, set fire to them, and
returned in triumph, bearing as trophies the banners
of the churches which had been plundered.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duhesme resolves to besiege Gerona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Duhesme then resolved to undertake the siege
of Gerona, having concerted it with Reille, who
was to co-operate with him from Figueras. It
was an object of great importance; for while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
Gerona and Hostalrich were in possession of the
Spaniards, they would be able greatly to molest,
if not wholly to interrupt, the communication by
land between Barcelona and France. Materials
of every kind were found in the well-stored
arsenals and magazines of Barcelona, and the
horses, mules, and carriages of the inhabitants
of that city were put in requisition for conveying
them. So sure of success was Duhesme, and
so exasperated by his former failure, that he is

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, p. i. 80–85.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

said to have declared he would arrive before the
city on one day, attack it the next, take it on
the third day, and on the fourth destroy it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulties on the march.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>He began his march on the 10th of July, with
about 6000 men. From Barcelona to Gerona is
a journey of twenty hours; but Duhesme had
not calculated upon the obstacles which he was
to encounter on the way. The road for two-thirds
of the distance lies always within sight of
the sea, and in great part along the coast; the
Catalans, under D. Francisco Milans, had broken
it up, and annoyed him with great activity on
his left, while an English frigate, and some
smaller vessels, brought their guns to bear upon
him from the sea; these impediments delayed
him five days between Caldetas and San Pol.
On the 19th he divided his troops; one part
crossed the wild mountains of Vallgorguina to
S. Celoni, and endeavoured by a sudden attack
to get possession of Hostalrich. Twice they attempted
to escalade it, and were repulsed with
loss by the acting governor D. Manuel O’Sulivan.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
The other division continued the coast road,
losing many guns and much of its ammunition
there. They rejoined on the way to Gerona,
and arrived before that city on the 22nd, where
they were met on the following day by Reille

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, i. 85–87.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with 2000 men from Figueras; but Duhesme
had suffered so much on the march, that he was
in no condition for active operations, and the
remainder of the month was employed in preparing
for the siege.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Troops from Minorca land at Tarragona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the very day that the French General appeared
for the second time before Gerona, the
Marques del Palacio, with 4600 regular troops
from Minorca, landed at Tarragona. Many officers,
who had hitherto remained in Barcelona,
and several magistrates, escaped now from that
city to join it. The first measure of the Marques
was to strengthen the line of the Llobregat,
which the Somatenes and Miquelets, undismayed
by their late defeat, had again occupied. The
Conde de Caldagues was sent with a detachment
upon this service, and the garrison, who made a
vigorous attempt to dislodge him immediately
on his arrival, were repulsed. The Catalans were
now in high spirits, and with the assistance of
Lord Cochrane, in the Imperieuse frigate, made
a successful attack upon the Castle of Mongat,
a small fort on the coast, about nine miles from
Barcelona, which the French had strengthened,
as a point of support for their plundering incursions
to the eastward. About an hundred
prisoners were taken there, seven pieces of cannon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
and a considerable quantity or ammunition

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />August.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and stores. The enemy could no longer maraud
in that direction, and feeling great present inconvenience,
began to apprehend serious consequences

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Barcelona blockaded.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

from the blockade of Barcelona: the
British cruisers watched it effectually by sea,
and in the only part of the land now open to
them, which was the mountainous country in
their immediate vicinity, between the Llobregat
and the Besos, they had to contend with an

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, p. ii. 3–25.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

armed and exasperated peasantry; for even those
persons who would have remained quiet were
driven to despair by the system of fire and sword
which Duhesme pursued.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Barcelona.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Barcelona, with its fort Monjuich, is one of
the strongest places in Europe. It is remarked
by Swinburne, that the citadel was calculated to
overawe the inhabitants at least as much as to
protect them from a foreign enemy. For this in
fact it was built, when six hundred houses were
demolished for its site; and to the same purpose
it was now applied against the family which built
it, when Buonaparte’s perfidy had made the Bourbons
as popular in Catalonia as they had been
hated there during the war of the succession.
Every house in Barcelona lies exposed to Monjuich,
which stands singly on the south-west. A
new fortress had been erected there early in
Charles the Third’s reign, and it had that completeness
and magnificence which characterised
public works in Spain. On the sea side it was
considered impregnable, so admirably had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
natural strength of the situation been improved
by art; and toward the land the glacis had been
sloped at an incredible expense in such a manner
that no approaches could be made under shelter.
The population of Barcelona in 1797 was 130,000,
and if the increase since had been in proportion
to that of the ten years preceding, it must have
amounted to 150,000 at this time. Yet this population,
than which a braver and nobler-minded
people were no where to be found, was kept
under control by 4000 French, Lechi having
been left with no greater force. The city was
so completely at the mercy of the citadel and
Monjuich, that the invaders had nothing to fear
from open attacks. Their only danger was from
stratagems or famine. Against the former they
were always on their guard; and it was to open
the communication for supplies and reinforcements
from France that Duhesme had undertaken
the expedition against Gerona.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Junta of Catalonia remove to the head-quarters.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Marques del Palacio arrived in Catalonia
without treasure or provisions, and there was no
government to which he could look for either.
The contributions which had been raised had
already been expended, and nothing was to be
obtained by way of loan. A temporary resource
was found in the confiscation of French property;
for in these calamitous times the numerous
French families who were settled in Spain
bore their full share in the general misery and
ruin. These funds, however, could not long
suffice; and for the better establishment of some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
permanent system, it was agreed that the Supreme
Junta of Catalonia, which had hitherto
resided at Lerida, should remove from that inconvenient
situation, and accompany in future
the head-quarters. The Junta was newly constituted
accordingly, and the Commander-in-chief
was chosen president. The Marques would now
have marched to raise the siege of Gerona; but
such means as he would have deemed adequate
were wanting; he had no cavalry, the little which
there was in Lerida and Tarragona was unfit for
action, and perhaps he reasonably distrusted his
troops if they were led against a well-disciplined

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Caldagues sent to interrupt the siege of Gerona.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

army. Caldagues, however, was sent to harass
the enemy and interrupt the siege, with four
companies of regular troops, 2000 Miquelets and
Somatens, and three pieces of artillery. He was
joined at Hostalrich by more of these new levies,
making his whole number 4300 men, and he received
two cannon from that fortress. They
advanced to Castella, passing within sight of the
French encampment; some officers came out of

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 30–32, 52–55.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the city to confer with the Count, and a joint
attack upon the enemy’s batteries was concerted
for the following morning.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He attacks the enemy’s batteries with success.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This was on the night of the 15th; Duhesme
had been so harassed in his operations, and so
slow in them, that though he arrived before
Gerona on the 19th of July, it was not till the
morning of August 13 that his batteries began
their fire. It was directed chiefly against the
Castle, which, like that at Barcelona, bears the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
name of Monjuich, and which, with all the other
forts around Gerona, had been neglected, and
was in a state of great dilapidation. On the 15th
a considerable breach had been made. The garrison
was then strengthened with 900 men, who
were ordered to be ready at daybreak, and to
sally as soon as the relieving troops should be
ascending the hill of Monjuich; but instead of
waiting for this, they sallied as soon as they saw
them marching down the distant heights of St.
Miguel and Los Angeles. The execution therefore
was as rash as the plan, and certainly few
attempts in war have ever been made in which
there was so little reasonable prospect of success.
The besieging army consisted of 11,000 men, of
which 1000 were cavalry, all disciplined soldiers,
upon whom their officers could rely. There were
4700 regular troops in Gerona, who, for want of
discipline, were not to be relied on in the field;
and of the force which Caldagues had now collected,
amounting to 6000, there were but 300
regulars. But Duhesme was at this time too
much dispirited by the general prospect of affairs
in Spain, and the reverses which he himself had
suffered, to be sensible of his own superiority,
or to profit by the errors of his opponents. One
battery was taken at the point of the bayonet in
this premature sally, and presently set on fire.
A second also was stormed; the French, who
had been driven from it, recovered it, being reinforced
by a Swiss battalion; but a column of
the Spaniards arrived in time to assist their countrymen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
and it was again taken, and the carriages
burnt. D. Henrique O’Donell, who held the rank
of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Sargento Mayor</i> in the regiment of Ultonia,
distinguished himself greatly in this part of the
action. The destruction of these batteries was
the object for which Caldagues had hazarded an
attack upon an enemy so greatly superior in
strength. His own troops, meantime, drove the
French from the heights of S. Miguel to the village
of Camp-Dura; from thence they, in their
turn, were driven back to the heights, and being

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 55–62.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

there reinforced, made the enemy again give way
before them, dislodged them from Camp-Dura,
and pursued them till they crossed the river Ter
to Sarria.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Duhesme raises the siege.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Caldagues dispatched news of his victory from
the field of battle to Tarragona, saying that the
enemy’s batteries were demolished, and all the
artillery taken with which they had battered
Monjuich in breach. All that he had hoped,
and more than he could reasonably have expected,
had been obtained; and when his troops,
flushed with success, would have exposed themselves
in the plain to the French cavalry, he restrained
them, ordered them to fortify themselves
upon the heights, and exerted himself to repair
the breach in Monjuich, lest it should be attacked
in the morning. Duhesme indeed might have
recovered in the night the positions which he
had lost, so little discipline was there among the
Spaniards, and so little watch or order was observed,
notwithstanding the strict injunctions of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
the Commander. But Duhesme appears to have
been one of those men who lose their powers of
mind when good fortune forsakes them; and Caldagues,
when day broke, and he was expecting
a formidable attack, discovered, to his astonishment,
that the enemy had disappeared. They
had fled, rather than retreated, in the night, and
in such haste, that they left several hundred barrels
of powder which they might with ease have
rolled into the river. Reille returned to Figueras
with little loss, there being no impediment in
that direction; but Duhesme, who did not venture
a second time upon the coast road, when
he reached Calella took a line between the high

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, Pieces Justif. No. 3. Cabañes, ii. 62–81.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

mountains and the sea, throwing his artillery
down the precipices, and abandoning great part
of the baggage and stores, and even leaving the
sick and wounded who were not able to sit on
horseback. The retreat was made with such precipitation,
that Milans, who pursued, did not
come up with them till they were within seven
miles of Barcelona, on the heights of Mongat.
But Lechi being, fortunately for them, apprised
by a spy of their approach, met them there with
part of the garrison, at a time when a small Spanish
force might have completed their destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Unpopularity of the commander in Catalonia.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>An outcry was raised against Palacio because
he had not intercepted the enemy in their retreat,
nor was he ever forgiven by the unreasonable
people for not having done what it was impossible
to do. When the account from the field of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
battle reached him at Tarragona, the French were
half way to Barcelona; and before he was apprised
that they had broken up the siege, they were already
in that city. The command which he had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 101.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

undertaken was no enviable one. The repulse
of the enemy at Valencia, their losses in Andalusia,
and the heroic defence of Zaragoza, had

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulties of the service.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

raised hopes which nothing but the most brilliant
success could satisfy; the service in which
he was engaged required great steadiness and military
skill; the best of his troops were wanting
in both, and the great body of them fit only for
irregular war. The Junta of Catalonia had decreed
that an army of 40,000 men should be
raised; and because there were no officers to
command, and no time for disciplining them,
they determined that the whole force should consist

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>D. Fr. Manoel Hist. de Catalaña, l. iv. p. 90.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of Miquelets. This class of irregular troops
was originally called<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>Almogavares; but when
they began to alter their savage appearance and
barbarous mode of warfare, they took their present
name from one of their favourite commanders,
Miquelot de Prats, a notable partizan
who attached himself to Cæsar Borgia. The
name was popular among the Catalans, the Miquelets
having distinguished themselves whenever
the country was invaded, and especially in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
the succession war. It was intended to raise
forty <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">tercios</i> of a thousand men each, and this
might have been done in a few days, such was
the national spirit, if equipments of every kind
had not been wanting. A great bounty was given
to these Miquelets, but this prevented recruiting
for the line, and the regular troops were disgusted
at seeing that men received larger pay
for engaging in a service where they had more

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, i. 90–93.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

liberty, and were subject to less discipline. On
the other hand, the Miquelet officers received
less pay than those of the army, and were less
esteemed, their rank being only during the war.
The force which was thus defective in its constitution,
was also ill armed. Sir Hew Dalrymple,
upon whom pressing demands for arms were
made from all that side of the peninsula, could
allot but few to Catalonia; and the abundant
supplies which had been sent out by England
were dispatched to other parts, where they were
neither so much wanted nor so well bestowed;
for Barcelona was the great arsenal of the province:
50,000 firelocks had there fallen into the
enemy’s hands, whereas the manufactory at Ripoll
could furnish the Catalans with not more than
150 per week. Palacio therefore ordered pikes
or partisans to be made, with which he armed
the two foremost ranks of the Miquelets, who,
as upon the old system, were drawn up three
deep. In hands that can be trusted with the
bayonet the pike would be a weapon hardly less
efficient; but for these raw troops the want of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
fire-arms lessened the little confidence which
they felt in themselves when they were brought
to encounter soldiers as well disciplined as armed.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 130–132.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Even the regular troops knew their own inferiority
in the art of war. They were incapable of
manœuvring in the face of an enemy; for so
greatly had their discipline been neglected while
no danger was apprehended, that they had gone
through none of the rehearsals by which soldiers

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, i. 78.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

are prepared for real action; mere drilling
seems to have been all the instruction they had
received.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Marquis approaches Barcelona. Sept. 1.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>With this force, as ill officered as it was ill provided
in all other respects, the Marques removed
his head-quarters to Villa-franca, to maintain the
line of the Llobregat, and take advantage of any
opportunity for recovering Barcelona while the
blockade was kept up. An expectation that
something would be attempted by the inhabitants
seems to have influenced the Spaniards to
this measure, otherwise ill judged. The recovery
of Barcelona was indeed an object of the greatest
importance; but weakened as Duhesme then was,
a few thousand Miquelets, with the armed population,
would have sufficed to prevent the
incursions of the garrison, and the Spaniards
should have taken their post on the Pluvia instead
of the Llobregat, with the Ter for their
second position, and Gerona and Hostalrich to

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, 280.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

support them, ... there they could best have impeded
the efforts which the French would make
for relieving and securing to themselves the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
strongest place in Spain. A British force might
here have rendered the most essential service.
Deputies from the Junta of Catalonia were sent
to Madrid, to consult with the Council of Generals
there upon the affairs of the province;
and in the hope of obtaining British aid one of
them proceeded to Lisbon to confer with Sir
Hew Dalrymple. All that could be done in
that quarter was effected; the Spanish troops in
Lisbon were embarked for Catalonia; and the
British Government, sensible of what might be
effected there by timely measures, ordered thither
10,000 men from the army at that time stationed

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>British troops ordered from Sicily, but detained there by the commander.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

in Sicily. But a feint of invading Sicily was made
by Murat, who had succeeded Joseph Buonaparte
as Intrusive King of Naples; and the troops were
detained in an inactive and unworthy service,
when they ought to have been co-operating for
the most important ends with one of the finest
and bravest people in the world. At no other
time or place during the whole war could such
a body of English troops have been employed to
so much effect as at this time in Catalonia. Some
petty jealousies or idle forms had hitherto deprived
the Catalans also of cavalry when it might
have been most useful. There was a regiment
of hussars in Majorca, for which the Junta repeatedly
applied, and its applications were earnestly
enforced by the British officers who were
in communication with that island; but it was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 129.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

not till after a series of frivolous and vexatious
delays that they were embarked at length in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
beginning of October; and a detachment of them
had not reached the Llobregat more than twenty-four
hours before they were led to intercept the
enemy at S. Culgat, on their return to Barcelona
from a marauding expedition. Not expecting to
be attacked by cavalry, the French were taken
by surprise; they suffered a considerable loss,
and from that time confined their incursions
within narrower bounds. The troops from Portugal
soon afterwards arrived; reinforcements
also came from Valencia and Majorca; Palacio

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Cabañes, ii. 161.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was removed from the command, because of the
unpopularity which he had incurred, and was
succeeded by D. Juan Miguel de Vives.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bilbao occupied by the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The want of military knowledge and military
talent was never more severely felt in any country
than in Spain at this momentous crisis. It
could not be doubted that Buonaparte was preparing
to bring against the Spaniards that tremendous
force which none of the continental
powers had hitherto been able to withstand. If
he seemed to delay, it was only that the preparations
might be more complete; sure, meantime,
that neither Spain nor England knew at
that time how to profit by the interval, and that
very probably disunion might arise among the
Spaniards themselves, of which he might take
advantage. The French had paid dearly for the
error of dividing their forces, and advancing
where they had no point of support; they were
now in strong positions, receiving reinforcements
from time to time, and waiting in security till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
Buonaparte should come in person to complete
the subjugation of Spain, which they, as well as
the tyrant himself, believed could not be averted
by any human interference. About the middle of
August they sent a detachment to take possession
of Bilbao, a beautiful but defenceless city, commanded
on every side by its hanging gardens.
The inhabitants, inferior in number, ill armed,
and without any works to protect them, made a
brave resistance, in revenge for which the French
committed great enormities when they entered
the town: had they arrived a few hours later,
they would have got possession of arms, ammunition,
and money from England, which were
just entering the harbour.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulties in bringing the Spanish armies into the field.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A full sense of their danger, when the whole
wrong which was intended them was avowed,
had roused the Spaniards to their first great and
successful exertions. After their victorious troops
had entered Madrid, they were less alive to the
danger, and more sensible of the embarrassments
of their situation. Sudden efforts, directed by
the emergency which called them forth, would
no longer avail. Foresight and combination were
required for extensive operations; and these were
thwarted by selfish views, and still more by capricious
or obstinate tempers, which in this state
of general insubordination there was nothing to
restrain. The Galician army under Blake, having
the plains of Castille before them, could not advance
without cavalry in the face of an enemy
who had from three to five thousand dragoons;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
and Cuesta would not send his cavalry to act
under Blake, because of his quarrel with that
General and with the Junta of Galicia. The
Extremaduran army, from a similar feeling of
pride, was kept vapouring before Elvas, while
it was called for by all the authorities at Madrid.
A more vexatious impediment was interposed by
the Junta of Seville. That Board had thought
proper, when the army in Andalusia was first
raised, for one of its members to accompany the
Commander-in-chief, that no injury might arise
from delay in consulting the civil authority, and
perhaps also to rid themselves of Tilly, who was
the person appointed. When, to their disgrace,
they elected this man to the Central Junta, D.
Andres Miñano was deputed to the army in his
stead, with a salary of a thousand dollars per
month; but public opinion at Seville was so
strongly expressed against this misapplication of
the public money, and supported by so many
members, especially by the Archbishop, that the
allowance was reduced one half. The whole was
a needless expense, for the Junta was still so
tenacious of their authority, that this representative
was a mere agent to execute their
pleasure, and not to determine upon his own
judgement. They sent positive orders that the
army of Andalusia should not advance beyond
Madrid; and knowing that Castaños had delivered
his opinion strongly upon the impropriety
of regarding any army as belonging to its
own province instead of the kingdom at large,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
they let him know, that if these instructions were
disobeyed he should not be supplied with money.
At this time the French had driven the Spaniards
from Tudela, and pushed forward to Borja; the
troops which were opposed to them in that
quarter falling back upon Zaragoza. Pressing
demands for support came from Palafox: the
Generals who were at Madrid saw that the Andalusian
army ought to advance without delay,
and this it could not do without money. This
matter was taken up warmly by the British
agents at Madrid and Seville; and as the Junta
of that city had received two millions of dollars
from the British Government, a strong remonstrance
was presented to them upon their present
conduct, and they were called upon to apply
it to the public service without delay. Their
reply, which, like all their papers, was written
with great ability, would have been satisfactory,
if they had not passed over in silence their orders
that Castaños should not advance. They argued,
that after all that Andalusia had done, it was
to be expected that La Mancha and the other
provinces which the Andalusian army was gone
to protect, would provide for it while it was employed
in their service. The sums which they
had received from Great Britain had been sent
expressly to them, as other sums had to the
Juntas of Galicia and Asturias, who had neither
incurred such expenses, nor contributed such aid
to other parts of Spain. But upon this matter
they waived all discussion; ... they answered the
bills which an English agent at Madrid had negotiated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
for the use of their army, authorized
Castaños to draw on them according to his wants,
and immediately sent forward 200,000 dollars.
This was just before the meeting of the Central
Junta: the Andalusian army was then advanced
to Soria, the Valencian under General Llamas
moved to Zaragoza, and Blake toward Miranda
upon the Ebro.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Marques de la Romana.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>One of the first things which Castaños had requested
after he had opened a communication
with Gibraltar was, that dispatches might be forwarded
to Romana, who commanded the Spanish
troops in the Baltic. He expressed the greatest
anxiety concerning him and his army, who had
been thus treacherously removed to so great a
distance from their own country, but at the same
time the fullest confidence in them and their
Commander. He judged of the men as Spaniards,
of the General by his individual character.
D. Pedro Caro y Sureda, Marques de la Romana,
was a man whose happy nature had resisted all
the evil and debilitating influences of the age
and country and rank in which he was born.
His public career was begun in the navy; but
having attained the rank of <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Capitan de Fragata</i>,
he quitted that profession for the land service,
a change not unfrequent in Spain. During the
French revolutionary war he served under his
uncle, D. Ventura Caro, who commanded on the
Biscayan frontier; and having distinguished himself
there, was made General of division in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
army of Catalonia, under Urrutia, where he continued
to be conspicuous for his good conduct.
When that miserably misconducted war was concluded
by a scandalous peace, Romana devoted
part of his leisure to the theory of his profession,
which he was the better able to study as having
received an excellent education, and made the best
use of it. And so evenly did he steer his course,
that without in the slightest degree courting
the favour of Godoy, or sullying himself by any
condescension, he never became an object of his
persecution; a singular instance of good fortune
in those disgraceful times, or rather of what may
be effected by undeviating rectitude and good
sense. For he possessed a rare union of frankness
and perfect prudence; and while his own
breast wore no disguise, and needed none, could
read with unerring intuition the characters of
others. There was in his manners that simplicity
which is the sure indication of generosity and
goodness, and which wins confidence while it
commands respect. Spain, where honour is the
characteristic virtue of the nation, where so many
heroic and illustrious men have arisen, has never
produced a man more excellently brave, more
dutifully devoted to his country, more free from
all taint of selfishness, more truly noble than
Romana.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Distribution of his troops in the Baltic.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The force under his command consisted of
about 14,000 men. They were marched to Hamburgh
in Aug. 1807, and quartered there, along
the Elbe and at Lubeck, as part of the army under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Marshal Bernadotte, then Prince of Ponte Corvo.
It was reported that this army was to invade
Sweden, in conjunction with the Danes, and the
Spanish division was put in motion accordingly
about the middle of March. But when the van-guard,
having safely crossed the Little Belt to
the Isle of Funen, was preparing for the passage
of the Great Belt, they were prevented by the
appearance of an English frigate and brig between
Nyeborg and Corsoer, at a season when it was
thought no enemy’s vessels would venture into
those seas. The remainder of the troops therefore
were of necessity ordered to halt, and were
quartered in Sleswic, till they should be able to
effect the passage. The Prince Christian Frederick,
of seventy-four guns, was sent to clear
the Great Belt of these enemies, but falling in
with the Stately and the Nassau, was captured,
after a severe action, close to the shore of Zeeland.
Bernadotte, who had crossed to that island
a few hours only before the English cruisers appeared,
was now, in order to return to his head-quarters
at Odensee, obliged to go round the
Isles of Falster and Laland, land in Sleswic,
travel to Kolding, and from thence cross the
Little Belt. Watching their opportunity, as they
could during the months of April, May, and June,
some of these troops got to the Isle of Langeland;
and some succeeded in effecting by night
the passage of the Great Belt from Funen to
Zeeland, the greater number still remaining in
Funen, or upon the coast of Jutland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their conduct when the oath of allegiance to Joseph was proposed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French journals affirmed that these troops
had taken the oath of allegiance to the Intruder
with unanimous enthusiasm. No man who knew
the Spanish character believed this falsehood.
They were in a situation where they were cut off
from all communication with their own country,
and where no intelligence could reach them but
what came through the French press, or other
channels equally under the control of the French
government. Nevertheless in these garbled and
falsified accounts they saw enough to convince
them that their countrymen were not submitting
to a foreign dominion so easily as the tyrant endeavoured
to represent. This opinion was confirmed
when a dispatch arrived from Urquijo to
Romana, requiring the army to take the oath to
the Intrusive King, that dispatch being the only
paper which the courier brought; ... it was plain,
therefore, that private letters were intercepted,
and that something must have occurred of which
it was important that they should be kept in
ignorance. When the oath was proposed, it was
taken without much demur by the troops in
Jutland under D. Juan Kindelan, the second
in command. Those in Funen, with the Commander,
refused it vehemently at first, but took
it at length conditionally, that is to say, with a
protestation that it was to be null if the changes
which had occurred in Spain were not confirmed
by the general consent of the nation. The regiments
of Asturias and Guadalaxara, which were
in Zeeland, were less placable; being under the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
immediate command of a Frenchman, General
Frerion, they attacked his house, killed one of
his aids-de-camp, and wounded another, and he
himself only escaped with life by disguising himself,
and flying to Copenhagen. The men then
planted their colours, knelt round them, and swore
to be faithful to their country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>An agent sent to communicate with him.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The British Government meantime had not
been inactive. The first difficulty was how to
communicate with the Spanish Commander. A
Roman-catholic priest, by name Robertson, was
found willing to undertake this dangerous service,
and qualified for it by his skill as a linguist.
One Spanish verse was given him; to have taken
any other credentials might probably have proved
fatal, and there was an anecdote connected with
this which would sufficiently authenticate his
mission. During Mr. Frere’s residence as ambassador
in Spain, Romana, who was an accomplished
scholar, had recommended to his perusal
the Gests of the Cid, as the most animated and
highly poetical, as well as the most ancient and
curious poem in the language. One day he happened
to call when Mr. Frere was reading it, and
had just made a conjectural emendation in one
of the<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a>lines; Romana instantly perceived the
propriety of the proposed reading, and this line,
therefore, when he was reminded of it, would
prove that Mr. Robertson had communicated
with his friend the British Ambassador. Mr.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
Mackenzie was sent with Robertson to Heligoland,
there to provide means for landing him on
the continent, and to make farther arrangements
as circumstances might direct.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He asks for a force to cover his retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The war with the Northern powers, and the
interdict against British goods, had given the
miserable island of Heligoland an importance at
this time which it had never before possessed.
Upon Mr. Mackenzie’s arrival, an embargo was
placed on the shipping there, and Robertson was
dispatched in a boat to land on the nearest shore;
but so vigilant a watch was kept wherever this
might have been possible, that after three days
he returned to the island, convinced there was
no hope of accomplishing his errand unless he
were provided with a passport. Fortunately a
vessel belonging to the port of Bremen had
recently been captured, and carried into Heligoland.
Mr. Mackenzie sent for the master, and
proposed to liberate him and his ship if he would
engage to procure a passport for Robertson at
Bremen. It happened to be in the man’s power
to redeem himself and his property upon these
easy terms, for he had a near relation in office in
that city. The engagement was faithfully performed;
and Robertson, whose appearance was
quite German, and who assumed the character
of a schoolmaster, found his way to Romana.
That noble Spaniard was greatly agitated at learning
the real situation of his country; the success
in Andalusia, the deliverance of Zaragoza, and
the retreat of the Intruder from Madrid, were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
not known in England at the time of Robertson’s
departure; but he did not hesitate a moment.
Their conversation was in Latin; and Robertson
was sent back with a request that Mackenzie
would proceed to the Baltic, and procure the
assistance of as many troops as might be necessary
to cover the retreat and embarkation of the
Spaniards. Ten thousand British troops, under
Sir J. Moore, had been sent to Gottenburg in the
month of May, to co-operate with the Swedes.
It was this aid that Romana required.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir Richard Keats goes upon this service.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This information was immediately communicated
to the British Government, and within a
week Mr. Mackenzie received letters for Sir John
Moore, directing him to employ the troops in
this service. Instead of sending these dispatches,
he thought it better to carry them, and confer
with that Commander in person, but when he
reached Gottenburg the expedition had sailed
for England. Having left Heligoland without
permission, he now attempted to return thither,
and for that purpose embarked in the packet. A
gale of wind drove it on the Danish coast. A
privateer, carrying sixteen guns, and well manned,
came out, expecting an easy capture; inferior as
the English were, both in men and guns, a fight
of four hours was supported, till the Dane put
his ship about, and the packet returned to Gottenburgh
in a shattered state. Baffled in this
intent, he thought his better course would be to
make for the fleet in the Baltic, and acquaint the
Admiral with the disposition of the Spaniards.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
Travelling therefore with all speed to Ystad, he
there found a Swedish vessel, which conveyed
him to Sir James Saumarez’s ship the Victory;
and upon his representations Sir James, without
waiting for instructions, ordered Admiral Sir
Richard Keats, with part of his squadron, to the
Great Belt, there to act in concert with Romana.
While they were preparing, orders for the performance
of this service arrived. A Spaniard
attached to the embassy in London came out
with the dispatches, bringing letters from the Junta
of Galicia, and from individuals to Romana and
the second in command.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Plan for collecting the Spanish troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was of great importance that Romana’s determination
should be kept secret as long as
possible, lest the French and the Danes, who
were but too ready to have acted with them,
should overpower his dispersed forces. A young
Spanish officer crossing from Zeeland to Langeland
was taken by this squadron; the letters were
intrusted to him, he was secretly put on shore in
Langeland, and from thence crossed to Funen.
Such a messenger, it was thought, would not
excite suspicion. Admiral Keats proposed that
the troops in Funen should secure themselves in
a peninsula on the north side of that island, from
whence, if necessary, they might be removed to
the small island of Romsoe. The Danish gun-boats
would be rendered inactive if Romana was
able, and should think proper, to seize on the
town and port of Nyborg; but this the Admiral
thought would endanger the troops in Zeeland

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />August.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

and Jutland, by provoking the Danes to act as
enemies, when otherwise it might be hoped they
would be disposed secretly to favour the quiet
removal of the Spaniards, or at least to make no
serious efforts for impeding it. There was little
probability that any negotiation for their peaceable
departure would be successful, subservient
as the court of Denmark was to the policy of
France; but after the movement should have
commenced, a declaration of the honourable and
unoffending object in view might be advantageous.
The two regiments in Zeeland, it was proposed,
should attempt to force their way to the
peninsula near Corsoer; if they succeeded in
this, they might probably defend the isthmus
there, till they could be removed to the little
island of Sproe, half way between Corsoer and
Nyborg. There were four regiments in Jutland,
distributed at Aarhuus, Ebeltoft, Greenaae, Randers,
Hobroe, Mariager, and some as high as
Aalborg on the Gulf of Limefiord. Orders were
sent to these that they should take possession of
such vessels as they could find at Randers, Aarhuus,
Fredericia, and Snogoe, and make their
way to Funen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Romana takes possession of Nyborg.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was scarcely possible that these movements
could be concerted without exciting suspicion,
prepared as the French officers and the Danish
Government were to expect some such attempt,
and especially after the manner in which the regiments
in Zeeland had expressed their national
feeling. The French Commandant in Langeland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
discovered that the officer who had passed from
thence to Funen had communicated with the
English ships. When Romana understood this,
he doubted not but that the French in Holstein
and Sleswic would be brought up by forced
marches; and as there were more than 3000
Danish troops in Funen, he thought it necessary
to take possession of Nyborg without delay. The
garrison were too weak to resist, and no violence

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 9.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

or incivility was offered: the concerted signal
was then made to Admiral Keats, who had hoisted
his flag the preceding day in the Superb off that
town; and he dispatched a letter to the Governor,
assuring him, that notwithstanding the state of
war between England and Denmark, it was his
wish to abstain from every hostile and offensive
act, provided no opposition were made to the
embarkation of the Spaniards. While this was
going on, he must co-operate with those troops,
and consequently often communicate with the
town of Nyborg; but the strictest orders had
been given that all under his command should
observe the utmost civility toward the inhabitants.
If, however, the Spaniards were opposed,
he must, however reluctantly, take measures
which might occasion the destruction of
the town.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The entrance of the British squadron is resisted.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Danish garrison had yielded to circumstances;
but an armed brig and cutter, which
were moored across the harbour, rejected all the
pacific offers both of the Spaniards and English,
and even the remonstrances of their own countrymen;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
such small vessels and boats as could
be collected were sent against them, and they
were captured after half an hour’s resistance and
some waste of lives. Romana had been careful
that no act of hostility should be committed by
his people, except what was absolutely necessary
for securing their embarkation; but some of them,
now irritated at the obstinacy with which their
friends and deliverers were opposed, fired a few
shots at the Danish ships from the batteries before
they struck. Admiral Keats then wrote a
second time to the Governor, saying, that as his
entrance into the harbour had been resisted, he
was bound by no law or usage to respect the
property of the inhabitants. The Spaniards had
occasion for some of the vessels in that port, and
unless the masters and crews would assist in
equipping and navigating them, he could not
secure them from injury; if they would, he
pledged himself to do so, and to grant them
passports to return in safety, after the short
service for which they were required should be
ended.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrival of some of the regiments from Jutland.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the same day that Nyborg was thus taken
possession of, the Spaniards, who were at Svendborg,
which is at the southern extremity of Funen,
got possession of some gun-boats, that might
otherwise have prevented their passage, and
crossed to Langeland. The regiment of Zamora
on the same day also arrived from Ebeltoft and
Greenaae at Middlefahrt; and starting from that
place at ten on the same night, performed the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
march to Nyborg in twenty-one hours, a distance
of more than fifty English miles. The regiment
which made this prodigious exertion for the sake
of returning to assist in the deliverance of Spain,
was one of those which the French papers described
as having displayed the greatest satisfaction
at the accession of the Intruder! The
troops which were at Hobroe and Mariager, and
those at Aarhuus, succeeded also in embarking,
and arrived safely in the port of Nyborg. The
two regiments in Zeeland were unable to escape;
three of the battalions had previously been disarmed
for their conduct when the oath was proposed
to them, and the others were now surrounded
by Danish troops: and there still remained
three cavalry regiments and one of infantry,
in Jutland, of which, and of the officers
sent to them, no account had been received.
While the troops were embarking on board such
vessels as were in the port of Nyborg, one of
these regiments arrived.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They leave the Isle of Funen.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The British Admiral had been at first of
opinion, that if the troops in Langeland felt
themselves safe, it would be better to land all
the others there, from whence they might be removed
at leisure. The possession of Langeland
had now been secured, but Nyborg was an insecure
position; it was reported that some thousand
French had collected upon the shores of
the Little Belt; and these, with the Danes in
Funen, and the garrison of Nyborg, might seriously
impede the embarkation from that town,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
or perhaps succeed in cutting off the rear-guard.
It was judged expedient, therefore, to spike the
guns there, and remove the troops to a neck of
land called Slipshavn, about a league distant; and
from thence they were shipped with as much expedition
as the unfavourable weather permitted.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Fate of the horses.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Two of the regiments which had been quartered
in Funen were cavalry, mounted on the
fine, black, long-tailed Andalusian horses. It
was impracticable to bring off these horses, about
1100 in number; and Romana was not a man
who could order them to be destroyed lest they
should fall into the hands of the French: he was
fond of horses himself, and knew that every man
was attached to the beast which had carried him
so far, and so faithfully. Their bridles, therefore,
were taken off, and they were turned loose
upon the beach. As they moved off, they passed
some of the country horses and mares, which
were feeding at a little distance. A scene ensued
such as probably never before was witnessed.
The Spanish horses are not mutilated, and these
were sensible that they were no longer under
any restraint of human power. A general conflict
ensued, in which, retaining the discipline
that they had learnt, they charged each other in
squadrons of ten or twenty together; then closely
engaged, striking with their fore-feet, and biting
and tearing each other with the most ferocious
rage, and trampling over those which were beaten
down, till the shore, in the course of a quarter
of an hour, was strewn with the dead and disabled.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
Part of them had been set free on a rising
ground at some distance; and they no sooner
heard the roar of the battle than they came thundering
down over the intermediate hedges, and
catching the contagious madness, plunged into
the fight with equal fury. Sublime as the scene
was, it was too horrible to be long contemplated,
and Romana, in mercy, gave orders for destroying
them; but it was found too dangerous to
attempt this; and after the last boats quitted the
beach, the few horses that remained were seen
still engaged in the dreadful work of mutual<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
destruction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 11.</span> The Spaniards are landed in the Isle of Langeland.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the second morning all were safely on
board, but the wind detained them in the harbour;
and there, on the evening of that day, the
regiment from Aarhuus joined them, in four vessels,
which they had seized. The one at Randers
did not succeed in making its escape. The south
part of Langeland was in possession of the Spaniards.
As soon as the wind permitted, their
fellow-soldiers were landed there. The whole
number was about 9000 men, with some 230

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Aug. 13.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

women and children. Stores and water were to
be laid in for their voyage to Gottenburg. The
Danish Governor, General Ahlefeldt, agreed not
to molest them, and withdrew his troops to the
northern part of the island, promising, that if
any French were known to arrive in Funen, he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
would then deliver up their arms. It was thought
necessary to demand them the ensuing day, upon a
rumour that this had occurred; and also because
a body of Danish cavalry had appeared
as if observing the Spaniards for some military
view; and because the escape of the French
Commandant had been facilitated by the General.
Some of the troops refused to obey, a detachment
was therefore marched against them
to enforce obedience, and this demonstration of
force was sufficient. They took the horses also,
having only about 200 of their own, which had
been brought from Svendborg; but they voluntarily
promised that these arms and horses, and
whatever else belonged to the Danes, should be
left upon the beach at their departure. Some
robberies, which a few of the men committed,
were instantly punished, and restitution made;
and a just price was fixed for the provisions which
were demanded: they were supplied, therefore,
without reluctance. Meat was in abundance,
but there was a difficulty in obtaining bread;
and the water lay at a distance from the shore, ...
a thousand men, and all the carriages that could
be procured, were employed in conveying it.
Their situation was still an anxious one: an
attack was to be apprehended from the opposite
port of Svendborg; it was known that the Danes
could collect as many as four-and-twenty gun-boats
there, and the channel would not admit of
frigates to defend it: a flotilla, indeed, came out
from thence one night, and kept up an idle cannonade<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
upon the Spanish encampment. It was
reported that French troops had arrived there,
and of this no certain information could be obtained,
for not a peasant in Langeland could be
induced by the offer of any reward to go and
ascertain the fact; an instance of national honour
which may more than counterbalance the unworthy
conduct of the Danish Government at
this time. That the French were not inactive
was certain. Proclamations from Bernadotte were
introduced into the camp, endeavouring to deceive
the Spaniards with regard to the state of
affairs in their own country, to excite suspicion
of the English, and to make them arrest their
leaders; but these papers provoked only the contempt
which they deserved.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They sail for Gottenburg, and there embark for Spain. <span class="date">Aug. 18.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the sixth day after their landing Admiral
Saumarez arrived, and in three days more, every
thing being ready, the troops were re-embarked.
The arms and horses which they had taken from
the Danes were left in the batteries. Before they
departed a flag of truce was sent to Copenhagen,
requiring, on the part of their Commander, that
the regiments which were detained should be
allowed to depart. The vessels from Aarhuus,
being manned by Danes, were supplied by the
British Admiral with stores for eight days, and
released. Those from Nyborg were manned
from the fleet, and an offer was made to send
them back from Gottenburg with the crews of
two Danish vessels which had been captured,
provided the Danes would release an equal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
number of British prisoners in exchange. But
these measures were not met with a corresponding
temper by the Danish Government, and the
convoy was fired at as it passed the battery of
Slipshavn. They reached Gottenburg in safety;
and the Spaniards there received the first intelligence
of the successes which their countrymen
had obtained. They were landed, for the
sake of health and comfort, upon the islands in
the harbour; transports from England arrived in
a few days, and this little army then sailed for
their own country, full of ardour, ... to lay down
their lives in its defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />September.</span>
<br /><hr />
Romana lands in England.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the convoy proceeded on its voyage
to Coruña, Romana landed in England, for the
purpose of consulting with the British Government.
It was there determined that his force
should be disembarked at Santander, to be incorporated
with the Galician army; and to avoid
all immediate difficulty concerning its support,
the existing armies in the present disorganized
state of Spain being raised and subsisted by their
respective provinces. Great Britain undertook to
pay and feed it for two months, by which time it
was supposed the Central Junta would be ready to
perform this part of its duties. These were troops
on whose discipline and courage entire reliance
might be placed; and Romana’s intention was to
triple the infantry, by forming upon each battalion
a regiment of three. And as it was designed that a
British army should advance to bear its part in
the first brunt of the great contest, the intention<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
was, that, if possible, it should act with Romana
on the left flank, and Castaños on its right. With
both these officers it was justly thought the service
might proceed in the true spirit of confidence
and good will; the reputation of both stood deservedly
high, and their disposition was even of
more importance, when operations were to be
carried on by concert between the generals, not
by a paramount and controlling command. For,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Error of the Spaniards in not appointing a Commander-in-chief.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

by a strange error, the Spanish Government had
resolved to make the commands independent of
each other. This error seems to have been committed
less from want of judgement than in deference
to the provincial Juntas, and in fear of
offending them; yet at that time public opinion
would have supported them had they appointed
Castaños commander-in-chief.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Difficulty of feeding their armies.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was not, however, the abilities of any single
general, however pre-eminent, which could have
saved the Spanish armies, constituted as they
then were, from inevitable defeat, unless a strong
British force had been ready to have acted with
them. Preparations upon an adequate scale had
been promised and intended by the Central
Government; but when they had raised men
and embodied them, the difficulty of maintaining
them occurred, a difficulty which has at all
times been greater in Spain than in any other
civilized country. Our own commissariat was
then far from effective; for great experience, as
well as great activity and talents, are required in
the business of providing an army: it is not then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
to be wondered at that the Spaniards, under their
complicated embarrassments, should have been
grievously defective in this main branch of the
military art; but this was one cause why the
number of their armies fell far short of their
computed force, many young recruits returning
to their homes, when they saw how miserably
they fared in the camp. It would have been
most desirable to have followed up the first
successes with vigour, and have attacked the
enemy while the impression made upon them
by so many humiliating failures was fresh, and
before farther reinforcements should enable them
to resume the offensive. But this had not been
possible. The French were strongly posted, and
well provided with all the means of war; and
their cavalry gave them complete command of
the plains of Castille. They had ravaged the
land from Burgos to Astorga, and driven in contributions
from the very gates of the latter city.
Blake could oppose no resistance to them in that
open country without cavalry, and for want of
that essential arm was obliged to alter his intended
plan of operations, and pursue, at considerable
risk, a different course. He resolved
to take a position between Bilbao and Vitoria,
and menace the right flank and rear of the
French, while the army of Aragon should act
on their left.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Bilbao taken and retaken. <span class="date">Sept. 20.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Bilbao had remained a month in possession of
the enemy; it was then retaken by the Marques
de Portazgo, and if his advanced posts had not

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />October.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

begun to fire too soon, the garrison might have
been surprised and made prisoners. After an
action of three or four hours they effected their
retreat, losing some 400 men. But considerable
bodies of French had now passed the Pyrenees;
and Marshal Ney, who came at this time to take
the chief command till Buonaparte himself should
arrive, feigning to retreat upon Vitoria for the
purpose of deceiving Portazgo, suddenly marched
with the centre of his army upon Bilbao. The
Marquis drew off in time, without losing a man
or a gun, and took up a position at Valmaseda.
There he was joined by a detachment of the
Galician army, and Blake immediately made
preparations to recover the city; but General
Merlin, whom Ney had left to command there,
knew that the place was not tenable against a
superior force, and evacuated it on the night of
Oct. 11.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Position of the armies in October.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French force at that time amounted to
about 60,000; and the Spanish Generals knew, by
an intercepted dispatch, that 72,000 more would
enter Spain before the middle of November. The
Spaniards were nominally 130,000, but the effective
number was very far short of this. With the
left or western army Blake occupied a line from
Burgos to Bilbao. The eastern army, that of
Aragon and Valencia, under Palafox, was stationed,
part near Zaragoza, and part was as far
advanced as Sanguessa, on the left of the enemy,
outflanking them on that side, as Blake did on
the west. The head-quarters of the central army,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
under Castaños, were at Soria; ... so that the whole
formed a crescent. The Spaniards now began to
experience the ruinous effects of that false policy
which had exaggerated their successes and their
strength, and had represented the final deliverance
of the country as an event soon and certainly
to be looked for. This delusion made the people
clamorous for the accomplishment of their expectations,
and the government itself either partook
or yielded to this impatience. The wise
precautions with which the Junta of Seville began
the war were disregarded, and the Central Junta
called upon the Generals to hasten their operations.
However strong, they said, might have
been the reasons for delay, loss of time had
already proved injurious, and must be more so
if the enemy should receive their expected reinforcements.
An end therefore must be put

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Commissioners sent to the Spanish armies.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

to this inactivity. And, as if dissatisfied with
their generals, they appointed D. Francisco
Palafox to go as their representative to the
armies, with the Marques de Coupigni and the
Conde de Montijo under him. He was to be
received with the same honours as a Captain-General
of the army, to confer with the Commanders,
concert operations with them, and
himself decide upon the plan of attack. Another
reason for this mission was, that Castaños
and Palafox differed totally in opinion concerning
the measures which ought to be pursued.
The latter was eager for action, because he believed
that every thing might be accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
by zeal and courage; the former understood
the art of war better, and knew how little
these qualities alone were to be trusted in the
open field against an enemy strong in cavalry,
equal in numbers, and superior in discipline.
The commissioners were sent to determine between
them. Of all the measures of the Central
Junta this was the worst. It was taken a few
days before Romana arrived in Spain. Had he
been present, his authority, coming in aid of the
opinion of Castaños, which was decidedly but
warily expressed, might have prevented so preposterous
a mission, and averted the evils which
were thus precipitated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.</span>
<br /><hr />
Buonaparte is deeply affected by the reverses in Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p><span class="firstword">It</span> had always been Buonaparte’s system, and
therein it was that the strength and wisdom of his
policy consisted, to ensure success, as far as the
end can be rendered certain by the employment
of adequate means. Having stripped Spain of
its best troops, introduced his armies into the
heart of the country, seized the most important
fortresses, inveigled into captivity the whole
Royal Family, and extorted from them a formal
renunciation of the crown in his favour; the
people, he thought, if they dared attempt any
partial opposition, would be effectually intimidated
by the first slaughter, and the military
executions which should follow it. His calculation
was erroneous, because the Spanish character,
and the strength of good principles, had
not been taken into the account. He had never
dreamt of a national resistance; and the defeat
of armies, till that time irresistible, affected him
the more deeply, because he felt that the measures

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marshal Gouvion St. Cyr, 18.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which had drawn on these disasters were
as infamous as he now perceived that they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
impolitic. The reverses which befell him in the
latter part of his bloody career he bore with the
coldest insensibility; but he was distressed by
these, and all but cast down.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He conceals them from the French people.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>But it was too late to recede; the infamy was
indelible, it remained only to secure the prize,
and this he believed there would be no difficulty
in effecting. His first care was to conceal from
the French all knowledge of the mortifying failure
his arms had experienced, till he should have secured
the subserviency of the other continental
powers, and collected fresh armies to pour into
the peninsula. His system of government was
founded upon falsehood as well as force. While
all Spain was in arms, the French papers represented
it as joyfully welcoming its new sovereign.
“The disturbances,” they said, “which broke
out in a few provinces were completely quelled:
they had been occasioned only by the common
people, who wished to pillage the rich: the disaffected
had got together some bands of smugglers,
opened the prisons, and put arms into the
hands of the felons: these wretches had committed
great excesses upon their peaceful countrymen,
but every thing was now quiet. The
captains-general, the magistrates, and the polished
part of the nation, displayed the best sentiments,
and the greatest repose and best state
of mind prevailed. At Cadiz the public tranquillity
did not experience a moment’s interruption;
the inhabitants of that interesting city had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
resisted all the insidious offers of the English.
Throughout the peninsula, indeed, only a few
insignificant individuals had been led astray by
the spies of England. But the Council of Castille,
and the most respectable persons, had exerted
their influence with all ranks, to crush the
seeds of sedition before they should shoot forth;
and their efforts had been completely successful.”
Over great part of France and of the continent
these accounts would be believed; wherever, indeed,
a vigilant tyranny could keep out all information
except its own. But at Bayonne it
was not possible that the truth could be concealed;
and by the falsehood which was officially
circulated in that part of the country, it seems
that the general opinion there was strongly
against a war, provoked solely for the aggrandizement

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">June 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the Buonaparte family. M. Champagny
addressed a note to the prefect of the
Gironde, informing him, that the Emperor had
just received advices from his brother the King
of Holland, saying the King of England was
dead, and that the first act of George IV. had
been to make a total change of ministers. This
was not given as a report, but as an authenticated
fact, officially communicated: “and may
this event,” it was added, “be the presage of
a general peace, ... the object of the Emperor’s
wishes, to the want of which Europe is so sensible,
and which would be so advantageous to the
commerce of Bourdeaux in particular!” The
same falsehood was repeated in that number of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
the Madrid<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> Gazette which contained Buonaparte’s
proclamation of Joseph as King of Spain
and the Indies. Buonaparte endeavoured also
to keep his allies as well as his subjects ignorant
of the real state of things. The Russian Ambassador
at Madrid could find no means of communicating
to his court an account of what was
passing in Spain, all his letters being intercepted
in France, till at the end of August, when some
British officers were in Madrid, an opportunity
was afforded him of sending his dispatches through
England; he then confided to the honour of a
hostile power what could no longer be trusted to
an unprincipled ally.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Statement of the French government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was not till two months after the capture of
the ships at Cadiz, and five weeks after the flight
of the Intruder from Madrid, that any account
of the affairs of Spain appeared in the French

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

papers, except assurances that all was well. A
long narrative was then published, written with
the usual falsehood of the French government,
but not with its usual skill. The insurrection
was ascribed entirely to the artifices and bribes
of England, assisted by the monks and the Inquisition,
... the Inquisition, which had lent its
whole authority to the usurpation! Great stress
was laid upon the excesses which the patriots
had committed; whereas the list of persons who
were here claimed as martyrs in the Intruder’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
cause did not equal in number the victims of one
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">noyade</i> in the Loire, scarcely exceeded that of
one day’s allowance for the guillotine in Paris.
The military detail, which was called a correct
abstract of the events of the campaign, was composed
with studied and inextricable confusion;
all order of time and place was inverted and involved,
and facts, exhibited thus piecemeal, were
still farther disguised by suppression, exaggeration,
and falsehood. At Valencia, it was said,
French intrepidity overcame every obstacle:
twenty pieces of artillery were taken; the suburbs
were carried, and the streets strewed with
dead bodies: ... this indeed was true; but they
were the bodies of the French. At Zaragoza,
fourteen cloisters, which had been fortified, three-fourths
of the city, the arsenal, and all the magazines
were in their possession. That unfortunate
city was almost ruined by fire, the bombardment,
and the explosion of mines. Not a
hint was given of the event of that memorable
siege. The loss of the fleet was not mentioned.
Dupont was so spoken of, as to make it evident,
that, if he returned to France, his life would
atone for his failure. After a series of events
which could not be described, because they ought
to be a subject of judicial inquiry, he had committed
the triple fault of suffering his communication
with Madrid to be cut off, of letting himself
be separated from two-thirds of his army,
and then giving battle in a disadvantageous position,
after a forced night-march; and, manifesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
an equal deficiency of political as of military
talent, he had allowed himself to be deceived
in negotiations. This unexpected event, the
numerous descents of the English upon the coast
of Galicia, (where no English had landed, except
a few officers,) and the excessive heat of
the season, had induced the King to assemble
his troops, and place them in a cooler climate
than that of New Castille, and in a situation possessing
a milder atmosphere, and better water:
therefore, he left Madrid, and the army went
into cooler cantonments. The bodies of insurgents
scarcely deserved to be mentioned: they
defended themselves behind a wall or a house;
but a single squadron of cavalry, or a battalion
of infantry, was sufficient to put many thousands
of them to the rout. “All that the English
papers have published,” said Buonaparte’s gazetteer,
“is unfounded and false. England knows
well the part that she is acting; she also knows
well what she is to expect from all her efforts.
Her only object is to involve Spain in confusion,
that she may thereby make herself mistress of
such of its possessions as best suit her purposes.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Report of M. Champagny.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>At the same time, two reports from the minister
of foreign affairs were laid before the
French senate. The first of these bore date from
Bayonne, so far back as the 24th of April. Hitherto
the modern powers of Europe had always
thought it necessary to hold forth some decent
pretext for engaging in hostilities, however
iniquitous might be the latent motives ... but the
semblance of moral decorum was now contemptuously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
laid aside; and in this state-paper Buonaparte
was advised to seize upon Spain, for the
purpose of carrying on the war against England
more effectually, every thing being legitimate
which led to that end. No state in Europe was
more necessarily connected with France than
Spain: she must be either a useful friend, or a
dangerous enemy; ... an intimate alliance must
unite the two nations, or an implacable enmity
separate them. Such an enmity had in old times
become habitual: ... the wars of the 16th century
proceeded as much from the rivalry of the
nations as of the sovereigns: the troubles of the
League and the Fronde had been excited and
fomented by Spain; and the power of Louis XIV.
did not begin to rise, till, having conquered
Spain, he had formed that alliance with the royal
family which ultimately placed his grandson on
the throne. That act of provident policy gave
to the two countries an age of peace, after three
ages of war: but the French revolution broke
this bond of union; and the Spanish Bourbons
must always, through their affection, their recollections,
and their fear, be the secret and perfidious
enemies of France. It was for the interest
of Spain, as well as of France, that a firm hand
should re-establish order in her affairs, now when
a feeble administration had led her to the brink
of ruin. A king, the friend of France, having
nothing to fear from her, and not being an object
of distrust to her, would appropriate all the resources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
of Spain to her interest, and to the success
of that common cause which united Spain
to France and to the continent. Thus would
the work of Louis XIV. be re-established. What
policy suggests, said the report, justice authorises.
The increase of the Spanish army before
the battle of Jena was really a declaration of war:
the laws of the customs were directed against
French commerce: French merchants were aggrieved,
while the ports were open to the contraband
trade of England, and English merchandize
was spread through Spain into the rest of
Europe: Spain, therefore, was actually in a state
of war with the Emperor.</p>

<p>Even M. Champagny, however, had not the
effrontery to press this conclusion. Exclusive
of this, he said, existing circumstances did not
permit the Emperor to refrain from interfering
in the affairs of Spain. He was called upon to
judge between the father and the son. Which
part would he take? Would he sacrifice the
cause of sovereigns, and sanction an outrage
against the majesty of the throne? Would he
leave on the throne a prince who could not withdraw
himself from the yoke of England? In that
case, France must constantly keep a powerful
army on foot in Spain. Would he reinstate
Charles IV.? This could not be effected without
overcoming a great resistance, and shedding
French blood. And should that blood, of which
France was prodigal for her own interests, be
shed for a foreign king, whose fate was of no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
consequence to her? Lastly, would he abandon
the Spanish nation to themselves, and while
England was sowing the seeds of trouble and of
anarchy, leave this new prey for England to devour?
This was not to be thought of. The
Emperor, therefore, occupied, of necessity, with
the regeneration of Spain, in a manner useful to
that kingdom and to France, ought neither to
re-establish the dethroned king, nor to leave his
son upon the throne; for in either case it would
be delivering her to the English. Policy advised,
and justice authorized him to provide for the
security of the empire, and to save Spain from
the influence of England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Second report.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Thus was the principle, that whatever is profitable
is right, openly proclaimed by the French
government, ... a principle which the very thief,
on his career to the gallows, dares not avow to
himself. The other report from the same minister

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Sept. 1.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

was of four months later date, though the
former had plainly not been written till it was
thought expedient to publish it: for the Tyrant
needed no adviser in his conduct at Bayonne;
and if his usurpation had been passively submitted
to by the Spaniards, Spain would have
been represented as the brave and faithful ally
of France, and the new dynasty exhibited as the
reward of her loyalty, which was now to be the
means of curbing her hostile disposition. This
second report began by proposing to the Emperor
that he should communicate to the Senate
the treaties which had placed the crown of Spain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
in his hands, and the constitution, which, under
his auspices, and enlightened by his advice, the
Junta at Bayonne, after free and mature deliberation,
had adopted, for the glory of the
Spanish name, and the prosperity of Spain and
its colonies. He had interfered with Spain, it
said, as a mediator; but his persuasive means,
and his measures of wise and humane policy,
had not been successful. Individual interests,
foreign intrigues, and the influence of foreign
corruption had prevailed. The disturbances in
Spain were occasioned by English gold. Would,
then, his Majesty permit England to say, “Spain
is one of my provinces! My flag, driven from
the Baltic, the North sea, the Levant, and even
from the shores of Persia, rules in the ports of
France?” No, never! To prevent so much disgrace
and misfortune, two millions of brave men
were ready to scale the Pyrenees, and chase the
English from the peninsula. If the French fought
for the liberty of the seas, they must begin by
wresting Spain from the influence of the tyrant
of the ocean. If they fought for peace, they
could not obtain it till they had driven the
enemies of peace from Spain. If they fought
for honour, they must promptly inflict vengeance
for the outrages committed against the French
name in Spain. The probability of meeting the
English at last, of fighting them man to man, of
making them feel the evils of war themselves, ...
evils of which they were ignorant, having only
caused them by their gold, was represented as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
no small advantage. They will be beaten, said
M. Champagny, destroyed, dispersed, or, at least,
they will make haste to fly, as they did at Toulon,
at the Helder, at Dunkirk, in Sweden, ... wherever
the French armies have been able to find them!
But their expulsion from Spain would be the
ruin of their cause; it would exhaust their means,
and annihilate their last hope. In this contest
the wishes of all Europe would be with France!</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Report of the war-minister.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These reports, with the two mock treaties of
Bayonne, were laid before the Senate, and, at
the same time, a report of the war-minister was
presented. France, it was said, had never possessed
more numerous or better appointed armies,
neither were they ever better kept up, or better
provisioned. Nevertheless, the events which had
taken place in Spain had occasioned a pretty
considerable loss, in consequence of an operation,
not less inconceivable than painful, of the division
under General Dupont. His Majesty had notified
his resolution of assembling more than
200,000 men beyond the Pyrenees, without
weakening either the armies in Germany or that
in Dalmatia. A levy of 80,000 was therefore
indispensable, and these could only be taken
from the four classes of the conscription of the
years 1806, 7, 8, and 9, which, exclusive of the
men who had married within those years, might
furnish 600,000. In levying 80,000, only one
conscript out of seven would be called out, and
the vacancies in the armies would thus be filled
up with soldiers of 21, 22, and 23 years of age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
that is, with men fit to undergo the fatigues of
war. “It is true, Sire,” said the war-minister,
“that the custom observed of late years might,
to a certain degree, induce a part of your subjects
to consider themselves released from the
duty of the conscription, as soon as they had
furnished the contingent required for the year;
and, under this point of view, what I propose
might appear to require from your people a sacrifice.
But, Sire, there is no one but knows,
that, by the words of the law, your Majesty
would be authorised to call to your standard the
whole of the conscription, not only of the last
four years, but even of the antecedent years:
and even were there question of a real sacrifice,
what sacrifice is it that your Majesty has not a
right to expect from the love of your subjects?
Who among us is ignorant that your Majesty
wholly sacrifices yourself for the happiness of
France, and that upon the speedy accomplishment
of your high designs depend the repose of
the world, the future safety, and the re-establishment
of a maritime peace, without which France
can never enjoy tranquillity? In proposing to
your Majesty to declare, that henceforth no retrospective
call shall take an antecedent conscription,
I only participate, Sire, in your paternal
wishes. I think it expedient, at the same time,
to propose to your Majesty to order out the
conscription of the year 1810, determining the
amount of it, from the present instant, at 80,000
men ... to furnish the means, as occasion may
require, of forming camps of reserve, and of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
protecting the coast in the spring time. This
conscription would be raised only under the apprehension
of a war with other powers, nor would
it be called out before the month of January
next.”</p>

<p>Thus, then, it appeared that those persons
who had escaped from the conscriptions of four
years were again to stand the hazard of this
dreadful lottery, and that of the unmarried men,
between the ages of 21 and 23, one in seven was
to be sent to the armies! ... and this draught upon
the morality, the happiness, the vital strength,
the flesh and blood of the French people ... was
required, because their Corsican master had
thought proper to appoint his brother to be king
of Spain! The promise that no retrospective
conscription should again be called for, shows
plainly what the feelings of the nation were at
such a measure, when Buonaparte thought it
necessary to soothe them, by declaring, that it
was not to be repeated. This was not all: one
year’s conscription had already been anticipated,
another year was to be levied in advance, and
80,000 men, whose services, by these baleful
laws, were not due till 1810, were now to be

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Suspicion of the views of Austria.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

called forth. This was necessary, the report said,
because England and Austria were increasing
their armies; and it was an evil inseparable from
the present state of Europe, that France must increase
hers in the same proportion. A suspicion
of the intentions of Austria was now intimated.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
Its armaments, the war-minister declared, had
often excited his solicitude. He had been told by
the minister for foreign affairs, that the best understanding
prevailed with the court of Vienna;
but though it did not belong to his department
to dive into the views and interests of states, and
explore the tortuous labyrinths of politics, it was
his duty to neglect nothing for preserving to the
French armies, at all points, that just superiority
which they ought to possess. The plan which
he had proposed would give the army of Spain
200,000 men, without weakening the other
armies; and the conscription of 1810 would increase
the armies of Germany, of the North, and
of Italy, by more than 80,000. From such a
force what could be expected but the speedy re-establishment
of tranquillity in Spain, of a maritime
peace, and of that general tranquillity which
was the object of the Emperor’s wishes? Much
blood would be spared, because so great a number
of men would be ready to shed it.... Here
the tyrant’s principle is right: and grievously
was that parsimony of strength on the part of
his mightiest enemy to be lamented, which, by
never sending a force sufficient to insure its object,
so often wasted what it sent.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Message from Buonaparte to the Senate.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Sept. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>A message from Buonaparte accompanied these
reports, when they were laid before the Senate.
He mentioned his firm alliance with Russia, and
said, that he had no doubts of the peace of the
continent, but that he ought not to rely upon
the false calculations and errors of other courts;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
and since his neighbours increased their armies,
it was a duty incumbent upon him to increase
his: he therefore imposed fresh sacrifices upon
his people, which were necessary to secure them
from heavier, and to lead them to the grand result
of a general peace. “I am determined,”
said he, “to carry on the war with Spain with
the utmost activity, and to destroy the armies
which England has disembarked in that country.
The future security of my subjects, a maritime
peace, and the security of commerce, equally depend
upon these important operations. Frenchmen,
my projects have but one object in view ...
your happiness, and the permanent well-being
of your children; and if I know you right, you
will hasten to comply with this new call, which
is rendered necessary by the interests of the
country.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Senate approve his measures.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In the first of Buonaparte’s three constitutions
for France, the affectation of Roman titles, and
the false taste with which they were applied to
offices essentially different, were equally to be
remarked. The name of Senate, however, was
well retained under his imperial government, just
such a Senate having existed during those disgraceful
ages of the Roman empire, when a despotism,
similar to that which he had established
in France, was degrading their country, and preparing
the way for the universal barbarism and
misery which ensued. The baseness of those
wretches who sanctioned the iniquities and cruelties
of Tiberius and Caligula was equalled by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
obsequious senators of Buonaparte. On the day
after his message had been presented, they voted
an address, echoing the gross and palpable falsehoods
of his assertions, applauding his measures,
and appropriating to themselves, and, as far as
the crimes of a government can be imputed to
the people, to the French nation also, the guilt
of his conduct towards Spain. “Your Majesty,”
said they, “desires to defend solemn and voluntarily
concluded treaties; to maintain a constitution
freely discussed, adopted, and sworn
to by a national junta; to suppress a barbarous
anarchy, which now covers Spain with blood and
mourning, and threatens our frontier; to rescue
the true Spaniards from a shameful yoke, by
which they are oppressed; to assure to them the
happiness of being governed by a brother of your
Majesty; to annihilate the English troops, who
unite their arms with the daggers of the banditti;
to avenge the French blood, so basely shed; to
put out of all doubt the security of France, and
the peace of our posterity; to restore and complete
the work of Louis XIV.; to accomplish
the wish of the most illustrious of your predecessors,
and particularly of him who was by
France most beloved; to extend your great
power, in order to diminish the miseries of war,
and to compel the enemy of the continent to a
general peace, which is the sole object of all
your measures, and the only means for the repose
and prosperity of our country. The will of
the French people is, therefore, Sire, the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
as that of your Majesty. The war with Spain
is politic, just, and necessary.”... If the transactions
which are the subject of this history had
passed in remote ages, and such a narrative as
is here presented had been preserved to us, it
would scarcely be possible, when we found the
Senate of a great nation, like France, thus solemnly
approving and ratifying the conduct of
its Emperor, not to suspect that the history had
been handed down in an imperfect state; that
some facts had been suppressed, and others distorted;
for, however credible the usurpation itself
might appear, as the act of an individual
tyrant, that it should, with its attendant circumstances
of perfidy and cruelty, be thus represented
as a just and necessary act, by a legislative assembly,
and made the ground of a national war,
is something so monstrous, that it would startle
our belief; and, for the honour of human nature,
we should hesitate before we trusted human
testimony.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>March of the troops toward Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The conscription for which the tyrant called
was decreed without one dissentient voice, by
an assembly constituted for no other purpose
than that of executing his will and pleasure. His
other measures had already been taken. About
the middle of August he had ordered General
Gouvion Saint Cyr from Boulogne, to repair to
Perpignan, and there collect an army, with which
to enter Catalonia, as soon as Buonaparte himself
should enter Spain on the other side. He gave
him no other instructions than that he should<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
use all efforts to preserve Barcelona: “if that
place be lost,” said he, “to recover it will cost
me eighty thousand men.” The troops from
Prussia and Poland were recalled; they consisted
not of Frenchmen alone, but of Germans and
Italians, Poles, Swiss, and Dutch, Irish, and Mamalukes,
men of all countries and languages, of
all religions and of none, united into one efficient
body by the bond of discipline. They cared not
whither they were ordered, so it were only to a
land which produced the grape, ... upon what
service, or in what cause, was to them a matter
of indifference; war was their element, and where-ever
they went they expected to find free quarters,
and no enemy who could resist them. Not
a few of them when they heard, as they had so
often heard before, that they were now to give
the last blow to the tottering power of England,
believed they were about to march to England
by land through Spain; the desert, they said,
had separated them from that country when they
were in Egypt, and when they were at Boulogne
there was the sea; but they should get there
now. As soon as these troops had crossed the
Rhine, they were received with public honours
in every town along the line of their march. Deputations
came out to welcome them, they were
feasted at the expense of the municipality, and
thanked at their departure for the honour they
had conferred upon the place. This was Buonaparte’s
policy. But the conduct of the soldiers
showed what an enemy might expect from them,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
when their own countrymen, upon whom they
were quartered, did not escape ill usage. They
treated them as they had done the Germans;
and the allied troops took the same licence which
they had seen the French exercise among an

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rocca, 9, 12.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

allied and friendly people. Under the imperial
government every thing was subject to the sword.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Speech of Buonaparte to the troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte reviewed them at Paris. “Soldiers,”
said he, “after having triumphed on the
banks of the Danube and the Vistula, you have
passed through Germany by forced marches. I
shall now order you to march through France,
without allowing you a moment’s rest. Soldiers,
I have occasion for you! The hideous presence
of the leopard contaminates the continent of
Spain and Portugal. Let your aspect terrify and
drive him from thence! Let us carry our conquering
eagles even to the pillars of Hercules:
there also we have an injury to avenge!” The
capture of the French squadron at Cadiz had
never been published in France, and this hint is
the only notice that ever was publicly taken of
it. “Soldiers,” he pursued, “you have exceeded
the fame of all modern warriors. You have placed
yourselves upon a level with the Roman legions,
who, in one campaign, were conquerors on the
Rhine, on the Euphrates, in Illyria, and on the
Tagus. A durable peace and permanent prosperity
shall be the fruits of your exertions. A
true Frenchman can never enjoy any rest till the
sea is open and free. Soldiers, all that you have
already achieved, and that which remains to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
done, will be for the happiness of the French
people, and for my glory, and shall be for ever
imprinted on my heart.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />October.</span>
<br /><hr />
Conferences at Erfurth.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The preparations for war were answerable to
the arrogance of this harangue. All the roads
to Spain were thronged with troops, marching
from all parts of France and its dependencies toward
the Pyrenees. While they were on their
march, Buonaparte set out for Germany, to meet
his dependent German princes, and the Emperor
Alexander, at Erfurth. Some of the performers
of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Theatre Française</i> had orders to precede
him, that these potentates might be provided
with amusement. An opportunity was taken of
giving Alexander a momentous hint of the superiority
of his new friend: ... Buonaparte took
him to the field of Jena: a temple, dedicated
to Victory, was erected on the spot where the
French Emperor had past the night previous to
the battle: tents were pitched round it; and,
after a sumptuous breakfast, he was led over
every part of the ground which the two armies
had occupied, and left to make his own reflections
upon the spot where Prussia received the
reward of its long subserviency to France, and
of its neutrality when the fate of the continent
was upon the hazard. The immediate consequence
of the meeting was a proposal for peace
to Great Britain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Overtures of peace from Erfurth.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These overtures were made in the customary
diplomatic forms; but they were accompanied
by a joint letter from the Emperors of France<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
and Russia to the King of England. Having
been brought together at Erfurth by the circumstances
of the continent, their first thought, they
said, had been to yield to the wishes and wants

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 12.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of every people, and to seek, in a speedy pacification,
the remedy for the common miseries of
Europe. The long and bloody continental war
was at an end, and could not possibly be renewed.
Many changes had taken place, many states had
been overthrown. The cause was to be found
in the evils arising from the stagnation of maritime
commerce. Still greater changes might yet
occur, and all of them contrary to the policy of
the English nation. Peace was their interest, as
well as the interest of the continent. We unite,
therefore, said they, in intreating your Majesty
to listen to the voice of humanity, silencing that
of the passions; to seek, with the intention of
arriving at that object, how to conciliate all interests,
and by that means to preserve the powers
which still exist; and to insure the happiness of
Europe, and of this generation, at the head of
which Providence has placed us. The official
notes stated, that Russian plenipotentiaries would
be sent to Paris, there to receive the answer of
England; and that French plenipotentiaries would
repair to any city on the continent, to which the
King of Great Britain and his allies should send
theirs. It was added, that the King of England
must, without doubt, feel the grandeur and sincerity
of this conduct on the part of the two Emperors;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
that their union was beyond the reach
of change; and that it was formed for peace as
well as for war.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reply to the Russian minister.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Oct. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>In answer to the Russian minister, it was stated,
that however desirous his Majesty might be to
reply directly to the Emperor Alexander, the unusual
manner in which his letter was drawn up
deprived it entirely of the character of a private
and personal communication, and it was impossible
to adopt that mark of respect towards
him, without, at the same time, recognizing
titles which the King of England never had acknowledged.
This was a needless demurral.
We had sent ministers to treat with Buonaparte
since he had been Emperor of France, ... surely
this was, to all intents, an effectual recognition
of his title. It was weakening the moral strength
of our cause, to rest, even for a moment, upon a
point of punctilio. In every other respect, the correspondence
on the part of England was worthy of
the cause. An immediate assurance that France
acknowledged the government of Spain as party
to any negotiation, was declared to be absolutely
necessary: that such was the intention of the
Emperor of Russia, it was added, his Majesty
could not doubt. He recollected the lively interest
which that Emperor had always manifested
for the dignity and welfare of the Spanish monarchy,
and wanted no other assurance that he
could not have been induced to sanction, by his
concurrence, or by his approbation, usurpations,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
the principles of which were not less unjust
than their example was dangerous to all lawful
sovereigns.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reply to the overtures.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The letter of the two Emperors was fully and
most ably answered in an official note. The
King’s readiness and desire to negotiate a peace
on terms consistent with his own honour, and
with the permanent security of Europe, were
again declared. If the condition of the continent
were one of agitation and of wretchedness,
if many states had been overthrown, and
many more were still menaced with subversion,
it was a consolation to the King to reflect, that
no part of those convulsions could be in any
degree imputable to him. Most willing was he
to acknowledge that all such dreadful changes
were indeed contrary to the policy of Great
Britain. And if the cause of so much misery
was to be found in the stagnation of commercial
intercourse, although he could not be expected
to hear with unqualified regret that the system
devised for the destruction of the commerce of
his subjects had recoiled upon its authors or its
instruments, yet it was neither in his disposition,
nor in the character of the people over whom
he reigned, to rejoice in the privations and unhappiness
even of the nations which were combined
against him. He anxiously desired the
termination of the sufferings of the continent.
The war in which he was engaged was entered
into for the immediate object of national safety;
but, in its progress, new obligations had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
imposed upon him, in behalf of powers whom
the aggressions of a common enemy had compelled
to make common cause with him, or who
had solicited his assistance and support in the
vindication of their national independence. The
interests of Portugal and of Sicily were confided
to his friendship and protection; and he was connected
for peace, as well as for war, with the
King of Sweden. To Spain he was not yet bound
by any formal instrument, but he had, in the face
of the world, contracted with that nation engagements
not less sacred, and not less binding upon
his mind than the most solemn treaties. He
therefore assumed, that, in an overture made to
him for entering into negotiations for a general
peace, his relations subsisting with the Spanish
monarchy had been distinctly taken into consideration,
and that the government acting in the
name of his Catholic Majesty, Ferdinand VII.,
was understood to be a party to any negotiation
in which he was invited to engage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Reply of the Russian and French ministers. <span class="date">Nov. 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The answer of the Russian minister was, that
the admission of the sovereigns in alliance with
England could not be a point of any difficulty;
but this principle by no means extended to the
necessity of admitting the plenipotentiaries of the
Spanish insurgents, and the Emperor Alexander
could not admit them. He had already acknowledged
King Joseph Napoleon; he was united
with the Emperor of the French; and he was
resolved not to separate his interests from those
of that monarch. But Count Romanzoff added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
he saw, with pleasure, that, in this difference of
opinion respecting the Spaniards, there was nothing
which could either prevent or delay the
opening of a congress; because his Britannic
Majesty had himself admitted, that he was
bound to no positive engagement with those
who had taken up arms in Spain. Count Romanzoff
did not intend to insult a British King,
by telling him he might violate his word and
honour, because he was not bound to keep them
by any formal instrument; ... but M. Champagny’s
reply was intentionally insulting. “How,” said
he, “is it possible for the French government to
entertain the proposal which has been made to
it, of admitting the Spanish insurgents to the
negotiation? What would the English government
have said, had it been proposed to them
to admit the Catholic insurgents of Ireland?
France, without having any treaties with them,
has been in communication with them, has made
them promises, and has frequently sent them
succours.” The writer did not perceive what
warning this utterly irrelevant argument held
out to the disaffected in Ireland, by thus plainly
informing them, that however Buonaparte might
promise them support, he was at all times ready
to abandon them, whenever it might suit his
views. Menacing language was then introduced.
England, we were told, would find herself under
a strange mistake, if, contrary to the experience
of the past, she still entertained the idea of contending
successfully, upon the continent, against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
the armies of France. What hope could she have,
especially when France was irrevocably united
with Russia? France and Russia could carry on
the war till the court of London recurred to just
and equitable dispositions; they were resolved
to do so; and the English were admonished not
to lose sight of the inevitable results of the force
of states.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 9.</span>
<br /><hr />
Final answer of the British government.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Mr. Canning’s replies were equally decided and
dignified. To Count Romanzoff he expressed the
King’s astonishment and regret, that it should be
supposed he would consent to commence a negotiation
by the previous abandonment of the
cause of the Spanish nation, and of the legitimate
monarchy of Spain, in deference to an usurpation
which had no parallel in the history of the
world. He had hoped that the participation
of the Emperor Alexander in these overtures
would have afforded a security to him against
the proposal of a condition so unjust in its
effect, and so fatal in its example. Nor could
he conceive by what obligation of duty or of interest,
or by what principle of Russian policy,
his Imperial Majesty could have found himself
compelled to acknowledge the right assumed by
France, of deposing and imprisoning friendly
Sovereigns, and forcibly transferring to herself
the allegiance of loyal and independent nations.
If these were indeed the principles to which the
Emperor had inviolably attached himself, to which
he had pledged the character and resources of his
empire, and which he had united himself with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
France to establish by war, and to maintain in
peace ... deeply did the King of England lament a
determination by which the sufferings of Europe
must be aggravated and prolonged: but not to
him was to be attributed the continuance of the
calamities of war, by the disappointment of all
hope of such a peace as would be compatible with
justice and with honour. To the French minister
Mr. Canning said, he was especially commanded
to abstain from noticing any of those topics and
expressions insulting to his Majesty, to his allies,
and to the Spanish nation, with which the official
note of M. Champagny abounded. The King of
England was desirous to have treated for a peace
which might have arranged the respective interests
of all the belligerent powers on principles
of equal justice, but he was determined not to
abandon the cause of the Spanish nation, and of
the legitimate monarchy of Spain; and the pretension
of France, to exclude from the negotiation
the central and supreme government,
acting in the name of his Catholic Majesty,
Ferdinand VII., was one which he could not
admit, without acquiescing in an usurpation unparalleled
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>As soon as this correspondence was concluded,
the rupture of the negotiation was made known
in England, by a declaration which, while any
sense of honour remains in the English nation,
may always be recollected with pride and satisfaction.
The continued appearance of a negotiation,
it said, when peace was found to be utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
unattainable, could be advantageous only to the
enemy. It might enable France to sow distrust
and jealousy in the councils of those who were
combined to resist her oppression; and if, among
the nations which were groaning under the tyranny
of French alliance, or among those which maintained
against France a doubtful and precarious
independence, there should be any who were
balancing between the certain ruin of a prolonged
inactivity and the contingent dangers of an effort
to save themselves from that ruin ... to nations so
situated, the delusive prospect of a peace between
Great Britain and France could not fail
to be peculiarly injurious. Their preparations
might be relaxed, by the vain hope of returning
tranquillity, or their purpose shaken, by the apprehension
of being left to contend alone. That
such was, in fact, the main object of France
in the proposals transmitted from Erfurth, his
Majesty entertained a strong persuasion. But
at a moment when results, so awful from their
importance, and so tremendous from their uncertainty,
might be depending upon the decision
of peace or war, he felt it due to himself to ascertain,
beyond the possibility of doubt, the views
and intentions of his enemies. It was difficult for
him to believe that the Emperor of Russia had
devoted himself so blindly and fatally to the
violence and ambition of the power with which
his Imperial Majesty had unfortunately become
allied, as to be prepared openly to abet the usurpation
of Spain. He therefore met the seeming fairness<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
and moderation of the proposal with fairness
and moderation on his part real and sincere, expressing
his just confidence that the Spanish government,
acting in the name of Ferdinand VII.,
was understood to be a party to this negotiation.
The reply returned by France to this proposition
cast off at once the thin disguise, which had been
assumed for a momentary purpose, and displayed,
with less than ordinary reserve, the arrogance
and injustice of that government. The universal
Spanish nation was described by the degrading
appellation of the Spanish insurgents, and the
demand for the admission of its government as
a party to any negotiation was rejected, as inadmissible
and insulting. With astonishment, as
well as grief, he had received from the Emperor
of Russia a reply similar in effect, although less
indecorous in tone and manner. The King would
readily have embraced an opportunity of negotiation
which might have afforded any hope or
prospect of a peace compatible with justice and
with honour. He lamented an issue by which
the sufferings of Europe were prolonged; but
neither his honour nor the generosity of the
British nation would admit of his consenting to
commence a negotiation by the abandonment of
a brave and loyal people, who were contending
for the preservation of all that is dear to man,
and whose exertions, in a cause so unquestionably
just, he had solemnly pledged himself to
sustain.</p>

<p>Such an answer was consistent with the honour,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the principles, and the feelings of the
British people. Buonaparte anticipated it: his

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte departs for Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

proposals might have that effect which the English
cabinet had foreseen, upon the powers
which he oppressed, and they might deceive
the French people; at least they gave a popular
topic for his sycophants in the Senate, and those
whose office it was to mislead the public mind.
He himself knew what the result must be, and had
not for a moment suspended or slackened his preparations.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Oct. 25.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Before a reply could be made to the
first overture, he returned to Paris, and, in his
address to the legislative body, informed them
that he should depart in a few days, to put himself
in person at the head of his army, and, with
God’s help (such was the expression of the blasphemer),
to crown the King of Spain in Madrid,
and plant his eagles on the forts of Spain. It
was a distinguished favour of the providence, he
said, which had constantly protected his army,
that passion had so far blinded the English
councils, as to have made them abandon the defence
of the seas, and at last produce their army
on the continent. His vaunts and his impieties
were, of course, echoed by those whom he addressed:
but their flattery was far exceeded by
the language of some deputies from the new
Italian departments, who had audience on the
same day. The destinies of the whole world,
they told him, were confided by the Almighty
to his impenetrable views, to the supreme power
of his genius, to the miraculous exploits of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
arms. Hence a new order of things, already
written in the books of the Eternal, was prepared
for their country. In the necessity in
which he was to overthrow, to destroy, to disperse
all enemies, as the wind dissipates the
dust, he was not an exterminating Angel; but
he was the Being that extends his thoughts, and
measures the face of the earth, to re-establish its
happiness upon a better and surer basis. He
was destined before all ages to be the Man of
God’s right hand; the Sovereign Master of all
things. Language of more idolatrous adoration
was never listened to by the frantic Caligula, nor
uttered by the infatuated followers of Sabatai
Sevi. It was not, however, too gross for the
tyrant to whom it was addressed; and he applauded
it in his reply. Immediately after this
scene he left Paris, reached Bayonne on the 3d
of November, and, five days afterwards, put himself
at the head of his army at Vitoria.</p>

<p><span class="firstword">An</span> old prophecy was at this time circulated
in Paris, importing that the disasters which would
lead to the overthrow of the French empire were
to originate in Spain. It had probably been sent
abroad in the days of Louis XIV. when his designs
upon that kingdom were first manifested,
and the resistance which they would provoke
from the powers of Europe was foreseen. The
persons by whom it was now reproduced apprehended

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pasley on the Military Policy of Great Britain, p. 34.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that the English would land a strong
force in the north of the peninsula, so as to cut
off the French armies from their communication
with Bayonne. Like all desponding or discontented
politicians, they overrated the wisdom
and the power of the enemy. If indeed, when
an expedition was sent to Portugal, this had been
done at the same time, the issue can hardly be
deemed doubtful. We had disciplined soldiers,
ships to transport them, and means of every kind
in abundance; but vigour was wanting in our
councils, and in offensive war we had every thing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
to learn. It was, however, intended that an
army little short of 40,000 men should take the
field with the Spaniards; and had such an army
been in the field, under an able and enterprising
commander, subsequent events have given an
Englishman right to affirm, that no force which
could have been brought against it in one point,
would have been able to defeat it. But this intention
was frustrated as much by the precipitance
of the Spaniards as by the dilatoriness of
the British movements.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements against Blake’s army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>By the latter end of October not less than
100,000 troops had crossed the Pyrenees from
the side of Bayonne, to reinforce their countrymen.
The head-quarters were at Vitoria, where
they had continued since Joseph arrived there
on his flight from Madrid. The left wing, under
Marshal Moncey, Duke of Cornegliano, was
posted along the banks of the Aragon and the
Ebro, having its head-quarters at Tafalla; Marshal
Ney, Duke of Elchingen, had his head-quarters
at Guardia; Marshal Bessieres, Duke
of Istria, at Miranda, with a garrison at Pancorbo;
Marshal Lefebvre, Duke of Dantzic, occupied
the heights of Durango, and defended
the heights of Mondragon from the threatened
attack of the Spaniards. Blake had posted the
main body of his army in front of Lefebvre’s
force, and occupied with the rest the debouches
of Villarcayo, Orduña, and Munguia. He hoped
that the Asturian General, Azevedo, would cut
off the communication between Durango and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
Vitoria by Ochandiano, and that, by possessing
himself of the heights of Mondragon, and thus
getting in the rear of the enemy’s advanced
guard, he might be enabled to strike a great
blow. The plan was good, if it could have been
executed in time; but Blake persisted in it after
he knew that the French had received strong
reinforcements. Some trifling advantages, and
the confidence of the Spanish character, encouraged
him to this imprudence, by which he
exposed himself to be entirely cut off. It was
Buonaparte’s intention to take the advantage
which was thus offered him; and Lefebvre
therefore had been ordered to content himself
with keeping the Spaniards in check till the Emperor
should arrive; but his flanks were so much
annoyed by Blake, that this delay became inconvenient,
and on the last day of October the
French attacked him. After a long and well-contested
action of nine hours the Spaniards retreated
in good order by Bilbao and Valmaseda to
Nava, without losing colours or prisoners. No
artillery had been used, the country being too
mountainous for it. The enemy entered Bilbao
the next day; and the corps of Marshal Victor,
Duke of Belluno, arriving at this time, was directed
by Munguia and Amurrio to Valmaseda,
to fall upon the flank of the Galician army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Blake falls back to Espinosa.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">1808.<br />November.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Blake’s intention had been to fall back till he
could concentrate his whole force; but the second
division, and a part of the Asturians under Azevedo,
had their communication cut off; and as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
the French were strengthening themselves at
Arancadiaga and Orrantia to prevent the junction,
he prepared to attack them. They retreated
during the night of the 4th; but on the following
day a division of his army came up with 7000
of the enemy near Valmaseda, and drove them
from thence with considerable loss. Having thus
effected the junction, he attacked the enemy
again on the 7th at Gueñes, and turned their
left wing, but his own centre was unable to
advance; and perceiving that the French had
received very considerable reinforcements that
day from Bilbao, his own men too being exhausted
by hunger and fatigue, he deemed it
prudent to retire to Espinosa de los Monteros,
where he hoped to refresh and feed his men,
and draw artillery and supplies from Reynosa.
Seldom indeed have any troops endured greater
hardships. From the 23rd of October they had
been continually in the open air, among the
mountains of Biscay, during rainy nights and
the most inclement weather: they were all without
hats, great part of them half clothed, and
barefooted, and they had been six days without
bread, wine, or spirits; indeed, without any other
supply of food than the sheep and cattle which
were to be found among the mountains. There
had been a considerable desertion among the
young recruits; but from those who remained not
a murmur was heard under all these privations:
they manifested no other wish than that the
sacrifice of their lives might contribute to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
destruction of the enemy, and the deliverance
of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Espinosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The system of the French was to beat this
army down, as their increasing numbers enabled
them to do, by repeated attacks. Blake intended
to remain some days at Espinosa, for the purpose
of giving his men some rest. But having arrived
on the 9th, his rear-guard, under the Conde de
San Roman, one of the officers who had escaped
from the Baltic, was attacked on the following
day, by a far superior force. He immediately
posted his army in front of the town; Azevedo,
with the Asturians and the first division, on a
height to the left, covering the road to S. Andero;
the second division on a hill to the right;
the third and the reserve in the centre. The
van-guard was posted on a little hill close in the
rear of the centre, with six four-pounders. The
enemy were successful in their first attack, and
drove the Spaniards from a wood which they
had occupied; they returned, however, to the
charge, being reinforced with the third division,
and the action became general, except on the
left of the Spanish position. It continued for
three hours, till evening closed in; and Blake
thought the advantage was on his side, though
the enemy had gained possession of a wood and
ridge of hill in front of his centre and right.
The contest had been very severe, and a very
great proportion of the Spanish officers had
fallen, San Roman among them, and the Galician
General Riquelme, both mortally wounded. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
men lay on their arms that night, and Victor,
who commanded in this battle, brought up fresh
troops from his rear to the ridge. At daybreak,
when the main attention of the Spaniards was
drawn towards this point, he made his great attack
upon their left, commencing it with a strong
body of sharp-shooters; they were twice repulsed;
meantime one of their large columns,
under General Maison, came up and formed in
line; the sharp-shooters, being reinforced, returned
to the charge, and General Ruffin, with
his division, attacked the centre. There the
enemy were well resisted; but on the left they
succeeded, owing, in great part, it appears, to
the system which on this and the preceding day
was practised, of marking out the officers. Azevedo,
and the two Asturian Generals who were
next in command, fell; this threw the men into
confusion, and when they saw themselves cut off
from the road to S. Andero, and that the French
were advancing to occupy a height in rear of
the town which commands the road to Reynosa,
they gave way, and nothing remained but to
order a general retreat. They had to retire by
a bridge over the Trueba and a defile; and instead
of attempting to save the guns, which
would necessarily have impeded the retreat of
the army, Blake thought it better to employ
them till the last moment; this was done with
great effect, and they were spiked when the
enemy was close to them.</p>

<p>Blake was one of those men who would have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
been thought worthy of the chief command if
they had never been trusted with it. His talents
were considerable; he understood the theory of
his profession well, and could plan an action or
a campaign with great ability; but he was deficient
in that promptitude and presence of mind
which are the first qualifications of a commander.
His own game he could play skilfully, but when
the adversary disconcerted it by some unexpected
movement, he was incapable of forming new dispositions
to meet the altered circumstances. By
persisting against a superior and continually increasing
force in operations which had been calculated
against an inferior one, he exposed himself
to the imminent hazard of being entirely cut
off; and by advancing so far into a country which
had been stripped of its provisions, and with no
commissariat to follow him, he exhausted his
men. Under every privation he indeed set them
an example of cheerfulness, and let them see that
he fared as hardly as themselves; but this could
not counteract the effects of inanition. They
were in a state of famine when they arrived at
Espinosa, and would have found nothing there
to relieve them if 250 mules, laden with biscuits,
had not most opportunely arrived, sent by Major-General
Leith, who was forwarding partial supplies
toward them by every possible way. But
men thus hungered, and enfeebled also by long
continued exposure to cold and rain, were ill
fitted for close action, in which much depended
upon personal strength. Another and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
lamentable error was, that the troops from the
Baltic, the only thoroughly disciplined part of
his force, were brought into action after the first
defeat, and exposed by single battalions to bear
the brunt of every conflict; and thus they were
sacrificed in detail, giving melancholy proof, by
the devoted courage with which they stood their
ground, of what they could have effected, if, as
a body, they had been brought into some fair
field of battle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dispersion of Blake’s army at Reynosa.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Blake attempted with the remains of his army
to make a stand at Reynosa; his principal magazine
and his park of artillery were there; it is
one of the strongest positions in that strong
country, and had it been occupied in time, the
event of the campaign might have been different.
But the forlorn hope of collecting his scattered
forces there was soon defeated. Victor was pursuing
him closely from Espinosa; Lefebvre from
the side of Villarcayo. And from the side of
Burgos, where a fatal blow had now been struck,
Marshal Soult, Duke of Dalmatia, marched upon
Reynosa. No alternative was left him but to
retreat toward S. Andero, and the dispersion was
so complete, that there no longer remained any
force on this side to oppose the enemy. Yet in
justice to this ill-fated army it should be said,
that no men ever behaved more gallantly, nor
with more devoted patriotism. Without cavalry,
half clothed, almost without food, they fought
battle after battle against troops always superior
in number, and whose losses were always filled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
up with reinforcements. Nor did any circumstance
of disgrace attend their defeat; there was
no capitulation, no surrender of large bodies, or
of strong places; the ground on which they
fought was won by the French, and that was all,
as long as any body of the Spaniards remained
together. The magazines at Reynosa now fell
into their hands, and they entered S. Andero.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 16.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The Bishop saved himself in an English ship,
and General Riquelme expired as his men were
lifting him on board. They had borne him
thither from Espinosa; for, routed as they were,
they would not leave him to die in the hands of
the enemy. Here, and in some of the smaller
ports, the French found a considerable booty of
English goods.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte arrives in Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When Buonaparte arrived in Spain he was not
pleased at finding that Lefebvre had opened the
campaign; his hope had been to march a strong
force in the rear of Blake’s army, and thus place
it in a situation where it must either have been
destroyed or have laid down its arms. In crossing
the mountains near Mondragon he had nearly
lost one of his favourite Generals, Marshal Lasnes,
Duke of Montebello; the ground was covered
with frozen snow, his horse fell with him, and in
attempting to rise fell on him. He was carried
to Vitoria in a state of great danger, his body
covered with those discolorations which show
that the small vessels of the skin are ruptured,
the abdomen swoln, the extremities cold, suffering
acute pain, and with all the symptoms of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
inflammation in the intestines, from the shock
and the pressure. M. Larrey, who attended
Buonaparte in all his campaigns, had learnt a
remedy from the savages of Newfoundland, applied
by them to some sailors whose boat had
been broken to pieces and themselves dashed
by the waves upon their coast. A large sheep
having been first stunned by a blow on the neck,
was immediately flayed, the reeking skin was
sown round the Marshal’s body, while his limbs
were wrapped in warm flannels, and some cups
of weak tea were given him. He felt immediate
relief, complaining only of a painful sense of formication,
and of the manner in which the skin
seemed to attract every part wherewith it was
in contact. In the course of ten minutes he was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Larrey, Campagnes et Memoires, t. iii. 243–246.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

asleep. When he awoke, after two hours, the
body was streaming with perspiration, the dangerous
symptoms were relieved, and on the fifth
day he was able to mount on horseback and
follow the army.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defeat of the Extremaduran army at Burgos.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte reached the head-quarters at Vitoria
on the 8th, and immediately pushed forward
a corps under Soult against the Extremaduran
army in his front. Bessieres commanded the
cavalry, which had before proved so fatal to the
Spaniards at Rio Seco, and which had now been
greatly reinforced. This army, under the Conde
de Belveder, had been intended to support Blake,
and keep up a communication between his army
and that of Castaños. It consisted of about 13,000
men; and their Commander, a young man, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
aware that a superior force was advancing
against him, waited for the attack in an open

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 10.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

position at Gamonal. He had with him some of
the Walloon and Spanish guards, and a few regiments
of the line; the rest were new levies, and
among them a corps of students, volunteers from
Salamanca and Leon. These youths, the pride
and the hope of many a generous family, were
in the advanced guard. They displayed that
courage which might be looked for in men of
their condition, and at that time of life: twice
they repulsed the French infantry, and when
Bessieres with the horse came upon their flank,
fell almost to a man where they had been stationed.
The loss in killed was estimated at 3000, nearly a
fourth of this brave army; the victorious cavalry
entered Burgos with the fugitives, and the city,
which was entirely forsaken by its inhabitants,
was given up to be plundered. Bessieres pursued
Count Belveder, while Soult turned aside
toward Reynosa, to complete the destruction of
Blake’s army. One corps of the French marched
upon Palencia, another upon Lerma; from the
latter place the Count retreated to Aranda; there
also Bessieres pursued, and the wreck of the army
collected at Segovia; the piquets of the French
were now upon the Douro, and their cavalry
covered the plains of Castille.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Proclamation excluding certain Spaniards from pardon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the second day after the defeat of the
Extremaduran army Buonaparte established his
head-quarters at Burgos, and issued a proclamation,
granting, in the Intruder’s name, a pardon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
to all Spaniards who, within one month after his
arrival at Madrid, should lay down their arms, and
renounce all connexion with England. Neither
the members of the Juntas nor the general officers
were excepted: but wishing, he said, to mark
those, who, after having sworn fidelity to Joseph
Buonaparte, had violated that oath; and who, instead
of employing their influence to enlighten the
people, had only used it to mislead them: wishing
also that the punishment of great offenders might
serve as an example in future times to all those,
who, being placed at the head of nations, instead
of directing them with wisdom and prudence,
should mislead them into disorders and popular
tumults, and precipitate them into misfortunes
and war: for these reasons he excepted from this
amnesty the Dukes of Infantado, Hijar, Medina
Celi, and Ossuna, the Marques de Santa Cruz,
Counts Fernan Nunez and Altamira, the ex-Minister
of State Cevallos, and the Bishop of
S. Andero; declaring them traitors to the two
crowns of France and Spain, and decreeing that
they should be seized, brought before a military
commission, and shot. Those persons who had
sworn homage to the Intruder, compulsory as
that homage was, had unquestionably exposed
themselves to its possible consequences: they
had been forced into a situation in which the
only alternative was to become traitors to him,
or traitors to their country: but by what law or
what logic were they traitors to France, a country
to which they owed no allegiance, and with which
they had contracted no obligation?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Movements against Castaños.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From Burgos Marshals Ney and Victor were
dispatched with their divisions to act on the rear
of Castaños, and cut off his retreat, while Lasnes,
with 30,000 men, should attack him in front.
This last remaining army of the Spaniards is represented
by the French as consisting of 80,000
men, of whom three-fourths were armed. But
the nominal force of the conjoined armies under
Castaños and Palafox was only 65,000, and the
effective soldiers hardly more than half that
amount. Many of the Andalusian troops had
returned to their homes after the first success,
and many more had remained at Madrid, so that
though some thousands (mostly from Valencia)
had joined Castaños, his force was little more
numerous than it had been at Baylen. His own
opinion was decidedly against risking an action
in which there could be no reasonable hope of
advantage; but the commissioner, D. Francisco
Palafox, to whom the power of overruling the
General had been madly entrusted by the Central
Junta, determined that a battle should be fought,
and Castaños therefore was compelled to fight,
lest he should be stigmatized as a traitor, and
murdered by his own men, or torn to pieces by
a mob. Already the Conde de Montijo, who left
the army at this time, was every where accusing
him of treachery, because he had warmly opposed
a determination, the fatal consequences of which
he certainly foresaw.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Tudela.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The plan of the French against this army
was the same as that which they had practised
against Blake’s; they meant to rout it by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
powerful attack in front, and to destroy the
fugitives by intercepting them with a second
force in their flight. Their destruction was considered
to be as certain as their defeat, but Ney
was less expeditious in his movements than had
been calculated; and Castaños hearing on the
21st that this corps was advancing upon Soria,
while Lasnes and Moncey approached from the
side of Logroño and Lodosa, abandoned Calahorra
and fell back upon Tudela. On the 22d
Lasnes entered Calahorra and Alfaro, and at daybreak
on the following morning he found the
Spaniards drawn up in seven divisions, with their
right before Tudela, and their left extending
along a line of from four to five miles upon a range
of easy heights. The Aragonese, who had joined
only a few hours before by forced marches, were
on the right, the Valencians and the troops of
New Castille in the centre, the Andalusians on
the left. Their line was covered by forty pieces
of artillery. Situations were chosen by the enemy
for planting sixty pieces against them; but upon
seeing their own relative strength, and the confusion
which was observable among the Spaniards,
they preferred a more summary mode of attack.
General Maurice Mathieu, with a division of infantry,
forced the Spanish centre; and General
Lefebvre, with the cavalry, passing through,
wheeled to the left, and coming in the rear of
the Aragonese, at a time when that wing, having
withstood an attack, supposed itself victorious,
the fate of the battle was decided. At the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
time Lagrange, with his division, attacked the
left; a brave, and in some part a successful
resistance was opposed; and the action, which
began in the morning, was prolonged on this
side till darkness enabled Lapeña’s division to
fall back from Cascante to Tarazona, where the
first and third divisions were stationed, and had
not been engaged. There too the second division
arrived, which had been ordered to support
Lapeña; but though it received these orders
at noon, and the distance which it had to march
was only two leagues, either from incapacity in
the leaders, or want of order, it did not arrive till
night, after the action was decided.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of the defeated army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>According to the French 4000 Spaniards fell
in this battle, 3000 men, 300 officers, and thirty
pieces of cannon were taken, their own loss not
amounting to 500. The right wing, dispersing
and escaping how it could, assembled again at
Zaragoza, with some of the central division also,
there to prove that their failure in the field had
not been for want of courage. As soon as the
wreck of the left had collected at Tarazona, Castaños
ordered them to begin their march by way
of Borja to Calatayud. It was midnight, and at
the moment when they were setting forward a
chapel, which served as a magazine, blew up.
Many shells went off after the explosion; this
occasioned an opinion that an enemy’s battery
might be playing upon them, and the Royal Carabineers,
in the midst of the confusion, fancying
that the chapel was occupied by the French, presented<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
themselves sword in hand to charge it.
Presently a cry of treason was set up; it spread
rapidly; misfortune in such times is always
deemed a proof of treachery; those troops who
had not been engaged could not understand
wherefore they were ordered to retreat, and at
such an hour; a general distrust prevailed; some
corps dispersed, and they who remained together
were in a fearful state of insubordination. They
retreated however through Borja and Ricla, without
stopping in either place, and on the night of
the 25th reached Calatayud.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their deplorable condition at Calatayud.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On that same day Maurice Mathieu entered
Borja in pursuit, ... too late to make any prisoners.
Ney arrived on the day following. He had been
ordered to reach Agreda on the 23d, which, if
he had done, the wreck of this army must have
been destroyed; but he found a pretext for delay
in the fatigue of his men, and a cause in the
pillage of Soria. The people of that city, unmindful
of the example which the Numantines
had set them upon that very ground, opened
their gates to the enemy. This did not save
them from being plundered. Their church, and
their rich wool-factors, afforded good spoil to the
French; and for the sake of this booty, and that
he might extort all he could from the inhabitants,
Ney remained there three days, not because his
men had been over-marched. But this delay
enabled Castaños to reach Calatayud. He had
thus escaped the danger of immediate pursuit,
and men and officers had leisure now to feel the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
whole wretchedness of their situation. There
were neither magazines nor stores here; the
system of supplying the troops, which before
had been miserably incomplete, was at an end,
and the military chest, containing two million
<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">reales</i>, had been conveyed to Zaragoza. Desperate
with hunger, the men broke through all restraint,
and the inhabitants fled from their houses,
hardly less dismayed at the temper of their own
soldiers than at the vicinity of the French. The
muleteers attached to the baggage and artillery
could obtain no payment, nor food either for
their animals or themselves; such as could find
opportunity threw away the baggage, mounted
their beasts, and rode away; others abandoned
them altogether, cursing their ill fortune, and
yet glad to escape with their lives. The soldiers,
having nothing else to stay the cravings
of hunger, devoured cabbage leaves, or whatever
crude vegetables they could find, and many
literally dropped for want.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They are ordered to approach Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Here Palafox and the Aragonese army expected
that Castaños would have rallied, have
made a stand, and, acting on the offensive
as circumstances permitted, have saved Zaragoza
from a second siege, or at least have delayed
its evil day. They who formed this expectation
did not reckon upon the activity of
the enemy, and imputed to their own government
a promptitude and power which it was far
from possessing. Had the defeat of the central
army been apprehended in time, and measures<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
taken for supporting it, one of the first objects
would have been to have strengthened this point.
There had been no such foresight. The French
were in pursuit, and orders arrived from Morla,
who was one of the council of war, requiring
Castaños to hasten with his army to the defence
of the capital. He consulted accordingly with
the chiefs of division, and they resolved to march
by way of Siguenza; from whence they might
either repair to Somosierra, if that strong position
should still be retained, or to Madrid, if such a
movement should be more advisable. In that
direction, therefore, they recommenced their retreat,
after one day’s rest.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Measures of the Central Junta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Central Junta, mean while, was occupying
itself with measures ill adapted to such times.
While Blake’s army was fighting, day after day,
without clothing, without food, and without reinforcements
to recruit its ranks, they passed a
decree for the establishment of a special tribunal,
to try all persons accused of treason; its object
being not more to bring such as were guilty to
deserved punishment, than to rescue from suspicion
and danger those who were unjustly
suspected; for, under the existing circumstances
of Spain, they said, the people having suffered so
much from treachery, would naturally suspect
all those whose conduct it did not fully comprehend.
The tribunal, which was composed of
members from each of the great councils of state,
was to have a jurisdiction over persons of all
ranks: but not to carry into execution any sentence<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
of death, confiscation, or dismissal from
office, till they laid the whole case before the
Supreme Junta. A certain number of its members
might carry on the ordinary business, but a
writ for the arrest of any person, or the sequestration
of his goods, must be issued by the whole.
Especial provisions were made to prevent secret
arrest, or long confinement; and the papers of
the accused were not to be detained, as soon as
it was ascertained that they contained no relation
to the matter with which he was charged. No
proceedings were to take place upon anonymous
information, nor was any informer to be admitted,
who would not consent to let his name be
known. The humanity of these provisions is in
such direct opposition to the practice of the holy
office, that it seems to have been the intention
of the framers of this tribunal to render their
state inquisition as unlike as possible to that
curse and disgrace of their country. The tribunal
was particularly charged to inquire into
the conduct of those persons who had gone as
deputies to Bayonne, or who had submitted to
the Intruder at Madrid; endeavouring carefully
to distinguish between what was compulsory and
what was their own act and deed; and proceeding
with the caution and prudence required, where,
on the one hand, the public safety was at stake,
and, on the other, the reputation of many good
and honourable citizens. And when their investigations
had established the innocence of
any one, they were to consult with the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
Junta upon the means of restoring to him all the
credit and respectability which he had formerly
enjoyed.</p>

<p>By another decree, dated on the day when
Castaños was defeated at Tudela, they resolved
that honorary militias should be formed in all
towns which were not in the scene of war, in
order to prevent disorders, and to arrest robbers,
deserters, and ill-disposed persons. A more
remarkable measure related to the Ex-Jesuits:
their banishment was repealed, and they were
permitted to return to any part of Spain, and
there enjoy their pensions. The reason assigned
was, that it was a miserable thing for them to
be expatriated, to live far from their friends
and kin, and be abandoned to the mercy of
strangers; that it was now become difficult to
furnish them with the pensions assigned to them
by the crown; and that the sums thus allotted
were so much withdrawn from the circulating
specie of the kingdom, to increase that of foreign
and even of hostile countries. This late act of
humanity to the poor survivors of an injured
community, is not at any time to be censured;
but it is extraordinary that at such a time it
should have occupied the attention of the Junta.</p>

<p>Of these measures, all would have been unexceptionable,
and even praise-worthy, had they
been well-timed; but the Central Junta still pursued
the fatal system of deceiving the people as
to the extent and imminence of their danger.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
They addressed a proclamation to the inhabitants
of Madrid, saying, that they had taken all the
measures in their power for defeating the enemy,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 21.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

who, continuing his attacks, had advanced to
the neighbourhood of Somosierra; and that the
number of the French there hardly amounted to
8000 men. The enthusiasm with which the soldiers
were preparing to beat the enemies of their
country, they said, and their confidence in their
valour, was not to be expressed; and the English
were ready to march from the Escurial, to reinforce
the position chosen by the able general
whom the Junta had appointed, and to support
the operations of the van, who, by that time, were
already engaged with the slaves of the tyrant.</p>

<p>With such representations did the government
endeavour to deceive the people of Madrid, and
lull them into a feeling of security, when its duty
was, to have told them the whole extent of their
danger, and manfully roused them to those exertions
which the emergency required. But they
themselves still in some degree partook the delusion
which they inspired. Their confidence
in the Spanish character was too well founded
ever to be shaken; and they relied, with little
reflection, upon the natural strength of the country.
Their present hope was upon the pass of
the Somosierra. D. Benito San Juan, a judicious
and able officer, of high reputation, was
stationed there with the remains of the Extremaduran
army, which had with great promptitude<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
been reinforced. The Junta did not call to
mind with how little difficulty Vedel had forced
the stronger passes of the Sierra Morena.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Pass of the Somosierra forced.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte continued at Aranda till the 29th,
when his head-quarters were removed to Bocaguillas,
a village upon the skirts of the Somosierra.
There he learnt that about 6000 men
were entrenched upon the heights of Sepulveda,
and that a stronger body occupied the pass. The
advanced guard was attacked without the success
which the French expected; but the Spaniards,
instead of being encouraged by this advantage,
forsook their entrenchments and dispersed. On
the following morning the enemy, under M.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 30.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Victor, attempted the pass. Sixteen pieces of
cannon had been well placed to flank the ascent,
and some attempts had been made to break up the
road; but this easy means of defence had been so
imperfectly performed, that the pass was won by a
charge of Polish lancers. They were favoured in
their approach by a thick fog; but the Spaniards
must have strangely neglected the advantage of
the ground, when they suffered a strong mountain
defile to be taken by a charge of light horse.
The men, fancying themselves betrayed, betrayed
themselves by their own fears; they threw
away their arms, and dispersed among the hills,
leaving all the artillery and baggage to the enemy.
And now the way to Madrid was open.</p>

<p>During the series of disasters which thus rapidly
succeeded each other, there had been no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
time for the Junta to think of removing their
residence to the capital, still less for them to
take into consideration, on the appointed day, the
plan for forming a Regency, and convoking the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Central Junta retire from Aranjuez.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Cortes. They began now to feel themselves insecure
at Aranjuez; ... already advanced parties
of the French had approached the Tagus; wherever
they went there was no armed force to
oppose them; they had appeared at Villarejo on
the 28th, on the 30th at Mostoles; and if at this
time two or three hundred horse, with a few infantry,
had pushed on to Aranjuez, they might
with perfect ease have surprised the Junta, and
by depriving Spain of its government, have inflicted

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Jovellanos’s Memorial, p. ii. § 44.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

upon it a more dangerous injury than all
which it had hitherto suffered in the field. This
opportunity was overlooked by Buonaparte; and
the Junta, sensible of their danger when the consequences
of the defeat at Tudela and the rout
at Somosierra were known, deliberated whither
to retire. Florida-Blanca, who was sinking under
the burthen of years and the anxieties of his
situation, was for removing at once to Cadiz,
and a few others agreed with him. Jovellanos,
who added to his other virtues that of perfect
calmness and intrepidity under any danger, represented
that this would be sacrificing too much
for safety; and that the honour of the government,
as well as the public service, required that
it should establish itself as near as possible to the
theatre of war. Toledo was named, and rejected,

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />December.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

as having nothing but its situation to defend it.
Cordoba and Seville were proposed, but liable to
the same objection; and Badajoz, which was the
place that Jovellanos advised, was chosen: the
provinces every where were open to the enemy,
but Badajoz was a strong place, from whence the
Junta might correspond with the British army,
and with that which Romana was now re-forming
in the northern provinces from the dispersed
troops of Blake and the Conde de Belveder.
There they could take measures for raising new
armies in Extremadura and Andalusia; and if the
French should overrun those provinces, which
there was now nothing to prevent them from
doing, they might thence pass through Portugal
to those northern parts where the founders of
the Spanish monarchy had found an asylum from
the Moors; and where its restorers, animated
with the same spirit, might, in like manner, Jovellanos
thought, maintain the independence of
their country. They were to halt at Toledo on
the way, and there take such measures as circumstances
might require.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>State of Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Two days before the passage of the Somosierra
orders had been given to arm and embody
the people of Madrid. The people were ready
and willing, but this measure had been too long
delayed; nevertheless a permanent Junta was
formed, to maintain order, and provide for the
defence of the capital; and the latter object was
especially entrusted to Morla and to the Marques
de Castelar. Now indeed was the time for that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
city to have emulated Zaragoza, and the spirit
was not wanting in the inhabitants, had there
been one commanding mind to have directed
them. Priests and regulars came forward to bear
arms, and old men, and women, and boys offered
themselves for the service of their country; ... for
this purpose leaving their houses open, and their
property to take its chance, they employed themselves
in opening trenches, erecting batteries, and
barricading the streets. The pavements were
torn up, and women and children carried the
stones to the tops of the houses, to be used from
thence against the enemy. Parapets were made
on the houses, and the doors stopped with mattresses.
Whatever arms were in the possession
of individuals were brought forth, and about
8000 muskets were distributed. The troops who
were in the city, and the armed inhabitants, were
now assembled in the Prado, that they might be
distributed to their appointed stations; the first
step for establishing that order without which
all efforts in defence of the city would be ineffectual.
Great confusion prevailed, and when
the people called out for cartridges, Morla coolly
replied, that there were none. Happy had it
been for Morla, if the indignation which this
proof of negligence excited had been directed
against himself; had he then perished under the
hands of the mob, the treachery which he was
preparing would never have been known on
earth, and he would have escaped perpetual infamy.
But his character stood so high, that no</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Marques de Perales murdered by the populace.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

suspicion pointed towards him. It happened
that among those cartridges which had been delivered
in the morning some were found containing
sand instead of gunpowder; they had
probably been made by some dishonest workman,
or mischievous lad; but in such a time
of feverish irritation and imminent danger, the
fact was of course imputed to a deep-laid scheme
of treason, and the Marques de Perales was the
person upon whom the crime was laid. The
Duque del Infantado was informed that a mob
was hastening toward the house of this unfortunate
nobleman, and that he and his family
were in the greatest peril. Infantado himself
seems to have thought there was guilt somewhere;
he repaired instantly to the spot, meaning
to deliver over the suspected persons to a
proper tribunal, by which they might be tried;
but before he arrived Perales<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> had been pierced
with wounds, and his dead body dragged upon a
mat through the streets, the rabble accompanying
it, and exulting in what they believed his
deserved punishment.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duque del Infantado sent to the central army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The permanent Junta, who held their sittings
at the post-office, as the most central point, taking
into consideration the proximity of their danger,
thought that more reliance was to be placed upon
succour from without, than on any exertions of
the inhabitants. These persons were in truth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
unequal to the arduous situation in which they
were placed; even the example of Zaragoza had
not taught them what wonders might be effected
in a civic defence; and they did not consider,
that as the first insurrection, and the consequent
massacre at Madrid, had roused all Spain to arms,
a greater impulse would now be given if the
capital opposed a determined resistance. They
agreed therefore to content themselves with such
efforts as might prevent the enemy from instantly
forcing the town, and induce him to grant
terms of capitulation. If by this means time
could be gained for a diversion to be effected,
or a successful attempt made in their favour, it
would be well; but if not, their minds were subdued
to this. They counted upon succour from
San Juan’s troops, many of whom were now arriving,
and they dispatched Infantado to meet
the remains of the central army, and bring it

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Manifesto del Duque del Infantado, i. 10.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with all speed to the relief of Madrid. On the
2d of December, therefore, early in the morning,
the Duke set out on this forlorn commission,
accompanied by the Duque de Albuquerque and
a small escort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Madrid summoned to surrender.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Only an hour or two after their departure,
Bessieres, with the French cavalry, came within
sight of Madrid, and took possession of the
heights. Buonaparte arrived at noon on the
same day, being the anniversary of his coronation.
There were not more than 6000 troops in
the city, but there were ten times as many men
ready to lay down their lives in its defence; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
the sight of the enemy excited indignation, not
dismay. It was apparent that there was a total
want of order among the people, but that they
were in a state of feeling which might render
them truly formidable: the bells of all the
churches and convents were sounding, and from
time to time the shouts of the multitude were
heard, and the beat of drums. Preparations had
been made which evinced at once the zeal and
the ignorance of those by whom they were directed;
the batteries were so low, that it was
easy for the French to plant their guns where
they could completely command them; and they
were so near the wall, that there was scarcely
room to work them, and the men would suffer
more by the broken stones than the direct effect

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Infantado, p. 4.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the enemy’s shot. Buonaparte thought it
easier to force the city than he would have found
it; but though insensible to any humane considerations,
policy made him desirous of avoiding
that extremity. Such a catastrophe might
inflame the continent as well as Spain, by proclaiming
to all Europe how utterly the Spaniards
abhorred the yoke under which he had undertaken
to subject them. An aide-de-camp of
Marshal Bessieres was therefore sent to summon
the town in form; he was seized by the people,
and would have been torn to pieces if the soldiers
had not protected him. No communication could
be opened that day with those who wished to deliver
up the capital. In the evening the French
infantry came up; arrangements for an attack in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
the morning were made by moonlight; and at
midnight a Spanish Colonel, who had been taken
at Somosierra, was sent with a letter from M.
Berthier, Prince of Neufchatel, to the Marques
de Castelar, exhorting him not to expose Madrid
to the horrors of an assault. Castelar replied,
that he must consult the constituted authorities,
and ascertain also how the people were affected
by their present circumstances before he could
give an answer; and he requested a suspension
of arms for the ensuing day.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Morla treats for a capitulation.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>This reply was sent on the morning of the 3rd.
Before it arrived an attack had been commenced
upon the Buen Retiro, the favourite palace of
Philip IV. which had been fortified with some
care, as a point from whence the city might be
commanded. Thirty pieces of cannon soon made
a breach in the walls, and the place was carried,
after a thousand Spaniards had fallen in defending
it. The other outlets which had been fortified
were won also, but the French were repulsed
from the gates of Fuencarral and Segovia. Some
shells were thrown, in the hope of intimidating
the inhabitants. In the forenoon of the ensuing
day Berthier sent in a second summons. “Immense
batteries,” said he, “are mounted, mines
are prepared to blow up your principal buildings,
columns of troops are at the entrances of the
town, of which some companies of sharp-shooters
have made themselves masters. But the Emperor,
always generous in the course of his victories,
suspends the attack till two o’clock. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
defend Madrid is contrary to the principles of
war, and inhuman towards the inhabitants. The
town ought to seek protection for its peaceable
inhabitants, and oblivion for the past.” The
firing ceased, and at five in the afternoon Morla
and D. Bernardo Yriarte came out to Berthier’s
tent. They assured him that Madrid was without
resources, and that it would be the height
of madness to continue its defence, but that the
populace and the volunteers from the country
were determined to persevere in defending it.
They themselves were convinced that this was
hopeless, and requested a pause of a few hours,
that they might make the people understand
their real situation.... Hopeless, and without resources,
when threescore thousand men were
ready to defend their streets, and doors, and
chambers! This would not have been said if
Palafox had been in Madrid.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Speech of Buonaparte to the deputies.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>These unworthy deputies were introduced to
Buonaparte, and one of those theatrical displays
ensued in which he delighted to exhibit himself.
“You use the name of the people to no purpose,”
said he; “if you cannot appease them, and restore
tranquillity, it is because you have inflamed
them, and led them astray by propagating falsehoods.
Call together the clergy, the heads of
convents, the Alcaldes, the men of property and
influence, and let the city capitulate before six
in the morning, or it shall cease to exist. I will
not withdraw my troops, nor ought I to withdraw
them. You have murdered the unfortunate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
French prisoners who fell into your hands; and
only a few days ago you suffered two persons in
the suite of the Russian Ambassador to be dragged
through the streets, and killed, because they were
Frenchmen. The incapacity and the cowardice
of a General put into your power troops who
capitulated on the field of battle, and that capitulation
has been violated. You, M. Morla,
what sort of an epistle did you write to that
General? Perhaps it becomes you, Sir, to talk
of pillage; you, who, when you entered Roussillon,
carried off all the women, and distributed
them as booty among your soldiers. Besides,
what right had you to use such language? the
capitulation precluded you from it. See what
has been the conduct of the English, who are
yet far from piquing themselves on being strict
observers of the law of nations. They cried out
against the convention of Portugal, but they have
fulfilled it. To violate military treaties is to renounce
all civilization; it is placing generals on
a footing with the Bedouins of the desert. How
dare you then presume to solicit a capitulation,
you who violated that of Baylen? See how injustice
and ill faith always recoil upon the guilty!
I had a fleet at Cadiz, it was in alliance with
Spain, and yet you directed against it the mortars
of the city where you commanded. I had a
Spanish army in my ranks; and rather than disarm
it, I would have seen it embark on board
the English ships, and be forced to precipitate
it afterwards down the rocks at Espinosa. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
would rather have seven thousand more enemies
to fight than be wanting in honour and good
faith. Return to Madrid. I give you till six
o’clock in the morning; come back at that hour,
if you have to announce the submission of the
people; otherwise you and your troops shall be all
put to the sword.” Had there been a Spaniard
present to have replied as became him in behalf
of his country, Buonaparte would have trembled
at the reply, like Felix before the Apostle.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Surrender of Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The enemy had now been three days before
Madrid, and the ardour of the people was
deadened by delay and distrust. Deserted and
betrayed as they were, they knew not in whom
to confide, and therefore began to feel that it behoved
every one to provide for his own safety.
During the night the strangers who had come to
assist in the defence of the capital, and such of
the inhabitants as had been most zealous in the
national cause, left a scene where they were not
allowed to exert themselves; and at ten o’clock
on the morning of the 5th the French General
Belliard took the command of the city. Morla’s
first stipulation was, that the catholic apostolic
Roman religion should be preserved, and no
other legally tolerated. No person was to be
molested for his political opinions, or writings,
nor for what he had done in obedience to the
former government, nor the people, for the
efforts which they had made in their defence.
It was as easy for the tyrant to grant this, as to
break it whenever he might think proper. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
fifth article required that no contributions should
be exacted beyond the ordinary ones. This was
granted till the realm should definitely be organized;
and, with the same qualifying reserve,
it was agreed, that the laws, customs, and courts
of justice should be preserved. Another article
required, that the French officers and troops
should not be quartered in private houses nor
in convents. This was granted with a proviso,
that the troops should have quarters and tents
furnished conformably to military regulations, ...
regulations which placed houses and convents at
their mercy. The Spanish troops were to march
out with the honours of war, but without their
arms and cannon: the armed peasantry to leave
their weapons, and return to their abodes. They
who had enlisted among the troops of the line
within the last four months were discharged from
their engagements, and might return home; the
rest should be prisoners of war till an exchange
took place, which, it was added, should immediately
commence between equal numbers, rank
for rank. It was asked that the public debts and
engagements should be faithfully discharged; but
this, it was replied, being a political object, belonged
to the cognizance of the assembly of the
realm, and depended on the general administration.
The last article stipulated, that those generals
who might wish to continue in Madrid
should preserve their rank, and such as were
desirous of quitting it, should be at liberty so to
do. This was granted; but their pay was only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span>
to continue till the kingdom received its ultimate
organization.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Decrees issued by Buonaparte.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Notwithstanding the formality with which the
soldiers were included in this capitulation, very
few of them remained to be subject to its conditions.
Castelar and all the military officers of
rank refused to enter into any terms, and, with
the main body of the troops and sixteen guns,
marched out of the city on the night of the 4th,
and effected their retreat. The Council of Castille,
which had already suffered the just reproaches of
their country, had now to endure the censure of
the tyrant whom they had supported while his
power was predominant, and disowned when
the tide turned against him. He issued a decree,
whereby, considering that that Council had
shown, in the exercise of its functions, as much
falsehood as weakness, and that, after having published
the renunciation of the Bourbons, and acknowledged
the right of Joseph Buonaparte to
the throne, it had had the baseness to declare
that it had signed those documents with secret
reservations, he displaced them, as cowards, unworthy
to be the magistrates of a brave and
generous nation. Care, however, was taken to
except those who had been cautious enough not
to sign the recantation. At the same time another
decree was passed, abolishing the Inquisition,
as incompatible with the sovereign
power, and with the civil authority. Its property
was to be united to the domains of Spain,
as a guarantee for the public debt. A third decree<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
reduced the number of existing convents to
one-third. This was to be effected by uniting
the members of several convents in one; and no
novice was to be admitted or professed till the
number of religioners of either sex should be reduced
to one-third of their present amount. All
novices were ordered to quit their respective convents
within a fortnight; and those who, having
professed, wished to change their mode of life,
and to live as secular ecclesiastics, were permitted
so to do, and a pension secured to them,
to be regulated by their age, but neither exceeding
4000 reales, nor falling short of 3000. From
the possessions of the suppressed convents, a sum
was to be set apart sufficient for increasing the
proportion of the parish priests, so that the lowest
salary should amount to 2400 reales; the surplus
of this property should be united to the national
domains; half of it appropriated to guarantee the
public debt, the other to reimburse the provinces
and cities the expenses occasioned by supplying
the armies, and to indemnify the losses caused
by the war. Provincial custom-houses were
abolished, and all seignorial courts of justice;
no other jurisdiction being permitted to exist
than the royal courts; and another decree, premising
that one of the greatest abuses in the
finances of Spain arose from the alienation of
different branches of the imposts, which were,
in their nature, unalienable, enacted, that every
individual in possession, either by grant, sale,
or any other means, of any portion of the civil<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
or ecclesiastical imposts, should cease to receive
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Proclamation to the Spaniards.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte now addressed a proclamation to
the Spaniards. What possible result, he asked
them, could attend even the success of some
campaigns? Nothing but an endless war upon
their own soil. It had cost him only a few
marches to defeat their armies, and he would
soon drive the English from the peninsula.
Thus, to the rights which had been ceded him
by the princes of the last dynasty, he had added
the right of conquest: that, however, should not
make any alteration in his intentions. His wish
was to be their regenerator. All that obstructed
their prosperity and their greatness, he had destroyed;
he had broken the chains which bore
the people down; and, instead of an absolute
monarchy, had given them a limited one, with
a free constitution. The conclusion of this proclamation
was in a spirit of blasphemy, hitherto
confined to the barbarous countries of Africa
or the East. “Should all my efforts,” said he,
“prove fruitless, and should you not merit my
confidence, nothing will remain for me but to
treat you as conquered provinces, and to place
my brother upon another throne. I shall then
set the crown of Spain upon my own head, and
cause it to be respected by the guilty; <em>for God
has given me power and inclination to surmount
all obstacles</em>.”</p>

<p>But though Buonaparte had thus easily dispersed
the Spanish armies, and made himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_422">422</span>
master of Madrid, his triumph was not without
alloy. He now perceived with what utter ignorance

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Change in Buonaparte’s views concerning Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the national character he had formed
the scheme of this usurpation, and he complained
of having been deceived, when, in reality, he had
turned a deaf ear to all who would have dissuaded
him from his purpose. Till he arrived at Madrid,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>De Pradt, 180.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the people, as well as the armies, had disappeared
before him; the towns and cities were abandoned

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Rocca, 24, 55.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

as his troops approached. Twelve months before
there was no other country wherein his exploits
were regarded with such unmingled admiration;
they had a character of exaggerated greatness
which suited the Spanish mind, and as he had
always been the ally of Spain, no feeling of
hostility or humiliation existed to abate this
sentiment: now, it was not to be disguised from
himself that he was universally detested there
as a perfidious tyrant. But policy, as well as
pride, withheld him from receding; unless he
went through with what he had begun, he must
confess himself fallible, and let the world see
that his power was not equal to his will, and
then the talisman of his fortune would have
been broken. He had committed the crime
and incurred the odium; wherefore then should
he not reap the benefit, and secure the prize,
not for a brother, whom he began to regard with
contempt as the mere puppet of his pleasure, but
for himself? This was a feeling which he did
not conceal from those who possessed his confidence;
and Joseph, and the unworthy ministers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
who had abased themselves to serve him, were
made to perceive it, by the manner in which
Napoleon, regardless even of appearances, issued
edicts in his own name, as in a kingdom of his

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>De Pradt, 222, 225.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

own. The obstinacy of the Spaniards in refusing
to acknowledge his brother, he thought,
would give him ere long a pretext for treating
the country as his own by right of conquest.
Meantime no interval was to be allowed them
for collecting the wreck of their forces to make
another stand.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of the central army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Three days before the battle of Somosierra,
Castaños, with his broken army, recommenced
their retreat from Calatayud. Some ten miles
west of that city, near the village of Buvierca,
the high road to Madrid passes through a narrow
gorge, where the river Xalon has forced or found
its way between two great mountain ridges.
When D. Francisco Xavier Venegas, with the
rear-guard, consisting of 5000 men, reached this
place, he found instructions from the Commander-in-chief,
requesting him to suspend his
march, and take measures for defending the pass,
on which, he said, the safety of the other divisions
depended; and he desired him to place
the troops whom he selected for this purpose
under such officers as would volunteer their services,
promising to reward them in proportion
to the importance and danger of the duty. Venegas
was too well aware of its importance to
trust the command to any but himself, and he
replied, that he would halt there till the rest of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
the army was beyond the reach of pursuit. Early
on the 29th the French came up, 8000 in number,
under Mathieu. They commenced an attack
at eight o’clock, which continued for eight
hours: the Spaniards suffered severely; but they
maintained the pass, and they effectually disabled
this part of the French army from pursuing. On
the evening of the following day the army reached
Siguenza with all the artillery which they took
with them from Tarazona, notwithstanding the
bad state of the roads and the fatigue of the
men, who had been allowed no rest upon this
last march. Here Castaños received a summons
from the Central Junta, and resigned the command
to Don Manuel de Lapeña.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Lapeña succeeds to the command.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The situation to which this general succeeded
was deplorable. The artillery had indeed been
saved, and the pass of Buvierca most gallantly
maintained; nevertheless the army had suffered
during its retreat from all the accumulated evils
of disorder, insubordination, nakedness, and cold,
and hunger, and fatigue. Sometimes when the
rear-guard had been on the point of taking food,
the enemy came in sight, and the ready meal was
abandoned to the pursuers; this, though it was
the effect as much of panic in the soldiers as of
any want of conduct in their commanders, gave
new cause for dissatisfaction and distrust. The
men themselves were ready to fly at sight of
the French, because they suspected their leaders,
yet they accused their leaders of treachery for
not always turning and making head against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span>
enemy, ... not reflecting, that the officers in like
manner, though from a different motive, could
place no confidence in their men. Many dropped
on the way, overmarched, or foundered for want
of shoes; others turned aside because they considered
the army as entirely broken up: they
were ready to die for their country, but it was
folly, they thought, to squander their lives, and,
under the present circumstances, their duty was
to preserve themselves, and recover strength for
future service. The loss at Buvierca, too, had
been considerable. Before they reached Siguenza
the four divisions had thus been wasted down to
8000 men.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They arrive at Guadalaxara.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was on the evening of the last day of November
that they reached this point. Here message
after message arrived, requiring them to
hasten with all possible speed to Somosierra.
They set forward again the following day, the
infantry by Atienza and Jadraque, the horse and
artillery by Guadalaxara, in order to avoid the
bad roads, leaving the river Henares on their
right. This plan was soon changed; advices
reached them in the middle of the night at Jadraque,
that the pass of Somosierra had been
lost. It was now determined that the whole
army should march for Guadalaxara, for the defence
of Madrid; information of this movement
was dispatched to the Marques de Castelar, in
that city; and persons were sent, some to ascertain
the position of the enemy, others to learn
whither San Juan had retreated, in order that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
some operations might be concerted with him.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

The next day, when the foremost troops entered
Guadalaxara, they found some detached parties
of the enemy in the town, whom they drove out:
the first and fourth divisions, the horse and the
artillery, arrived there that night; here the news
was, that Madrid was attacked, and the continual
firing which was heard confirmed it. Poor
as the numbers were which they could carry to
the capital, they were eager to be there; and if
Madrid had been protected, as it might have
been, by a British army, or defended as the inhabitants,
had it not been for treachery, would
have defended it, 8000 men, who stood by their
colours under so many hopeless circumstances,
would have brought an important succour. The
inhabitants relied with great confidence upon this
reinforcement; ... they expected hourly that these
brave men would appear, and take post beside
them at their gates, and in their streets; and
one of the most successful artifices by which
the traitors who made the capitulation depressed
their zeal, was by reporting that a second battle
had been fought, in which the army of the centre
had been entirely defeated by Marshal Ney, so
that no possible succour could be expected from
it. At the very time when this falsehood was
reported, a part of this brave army was only nine
leagues from Madrid, impatient to proceed to its
assistance. They were, however, compelled to
remain inactive the whole of the next day, waiting
for the second and third divisions and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
van, which did not come up till the day following.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Duque del Infantado joins them.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On that day the Duque del Infantado joined
them, having passed safely through the advanced
posts of the French by favour of a thick fog. A
council of war was held; the urgent danger of
the capital was represented by the Duke, and
low as his hopes had fallen, when he saw the deplorable
state to which the remains of the army
were reduced by fatigue and hunger, it was nevertheless
determined that an effort should be made,
not to attack the besiegers, for this would have
been madness, but to collect as large a convoy of
provisions as they could, and endeavour to enter
with it under cover of the night by the Atocha
gate. The Duke, however, knew but too well
the situation of the metropolis; and at his suggestion
a letter was sent to the French General
who commanded before the walls, reminding him
that a great number of French were in the hands
of the Spaniards, and would be held responsible
with their lives for any ill treatment which might
be offered to the inhabitants of Madrid. Both
the officer and the trumpet were detained prisoners
by Buonaparte’s orders.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Condition of the troops.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Dec. 4.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The troops were now mustered, and it was
then perceived what they had lost in number,
and how severely they had suffered during this
fearful retreat. From 6000 to 7000 infantry,
and about 1500 cavalry, were all that could be
brought together; men and horses alike exhausted
by fatigue and hunger; many indeed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
had fallen and perished by the way. Here for
the first time they found something like relief,
great numbers not having tasted bread for eight
days: they had now sufficient food, and there
was cloth enough in the manufactory there to
supply every man with a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">poncho</i>, the rude garment
of the Indians about Buenos Ayres, which
the Spaniards have adopted for its simplicity and
convenience. Meantime the French were collecting
in their neighbourhood; they occupied
Alcala and the adjoining villages, and some skirmishes
took place at Meca. Buonaparte had
been informed of their movements, and as soon
as Madrid capitulated, Bessieres was dispatched
to Guadalaxara with a considerable force of horse,
and Victor followed with infantry. The first
business of Lapeña was to disencumber himself
of his superfluous artillery, for they had brought
off no fewer than sixty pieces of cannon. Forty
of these, to preserve them from the enemy, were
sent across the Tagus at Sacedon, and these were
safely forwarded to Carthagena. The van, under
Venegas, which had saved the army at Buvierca,
arrived on the night of the 4th. Its losses had
been replaced by drafts; the post of honour and
of danger had been assigned it during the whole
of this retreat, and it continued to cover the
movements of the other divisions. Two of them
were leaving Guadalaxara when it arrived, the
second and third followed the next noon, in two
columns, proceeding by two roads to Santorcaz:
this division began to follow them, but before it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
was out of one gate, the advanced guard of the
enemy entered at another.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They retire towards the Tagus.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Venegas perceived the importance of a position
to the south of the city, lying directly between the
two roads to Santorcaz, and he immediately,
occupied it. The battalions (<i xml:lang="es" lang="es">tercios</i>) of Ledesma
and Salamanca, which formed the rear of the third
division, perceived his intention, and turned back
and joined him; their commanding officers, D.
Luis de Lacy and D. Alexandre de Hore, being
ambitious of bearing part in the action which
they expected. The French were in great force
opposite on the right bank of the Henares; some
of their detachments forded both on the right
and left of the Spaniards’ position; but light
troops had been stationed on both the flanks,
who skirmished with them, and repelled them
till night. The position was judged too formidable
in front to be attacked, and the main body
of the French halted during the whole evening,
not choosing to cross the river. Having thus
obtained time for the army to perform its march,
which was all he hoped or wanted, Venegas
broke up three hours after the darkness had
closed, and continued his retreat in good order
without the loss of a single man. The Commander
now took up a position at Santorcaz, a
little village about two leagues east of Alcala,
between the rivers Henares and Tajuna. There
he learnt the fate of Madrid. The French now
evacuated Alcala, and extended themselves along
the heights at the back of Meca, and along the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
banks of the Jarama, pushing their advanced
parties to Arganda, Morata, and other places in
that neighbourhood. The plan of Lapeña and
his officers under these circumstances was, to
cross the Tagus at Aranjuez, and take shelter,
if necessary, among the mountains of Toledo.
With this intent they marched to Villarejo de
Salvanes. A few poor soldiers, who dropped behind
at Nuevo-Bastan, were sabred by the French
with that cruelty which at this time so frequently
characterised and disgraced their armies.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Passage of the Tagus.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 6th, when they were about to proceed
to Aranjuez, tidings came that the French were
in possession of that place, and this was confirmed
by an express from General Llamas, who had
vainly attempted to resist the enemy there with
a few armed peasantry, and a few soldiers who
had escaped from Madrid. New difficulties now
presented themselves to the remnant of this
harassed army. To look towards Toledo was become
hopeless: it was equally hopeless to make
for Andalusia, for the French General, Ruffin, as
soon as he had obtained possession of Aranjuez,
crossed the Tagus, and, pushing on as far as
Ocaña, cut off their retreat in that direction.
Nothing remained but to cross the Tagus by
boats at Villamanrique, Fuenteduenas, Estramera,
and other places where there were ferries,
and make for the Sierras of Cuenca. There it
was hoped they might be able to rest, rally the
stragglers, and again unite in numbers sufficient
to take vengeance for all their sufferings. Hazardous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
as it was to cross the river in this manner,
with an enemy so near at hand, it was effected
with rare good fortune; the French had not
foreseen the attempt, and not a man nor a gun
was lost. Having gained the left bank of the
river, they hastened on their retreat, and head-quarters
were established on the 7th at Belinchon.
The second division, under General Grimanest,
which crossed at Villamanrique, was the only one
which was endangered. This having effected the
passage, took up a position at Santa Cruz, between
Aranjuez and Ucles, where it was attacked on
the night of the 8th by a corps of Bessieres’ division,
under General Montbrun. Finding themselves
unable to maintain the position against a
force which was superior to their own, they
abandoned it before they sustained any loss.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Some of the troops mutiny.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The first and fourth divisions mutinied on their
march to Yedra, where they were to be stationed.
This was ascribed to the intrigues of some traitorous
agents, as well as to the unprincipled ambition
of a few officers, desirous, in these times
of insubordination, to exalt themselves by flattering
the soldiers and slandering their commanders.
It was easy to inflame the men, who imputed all
their misfortunes to treason, and were already in
a state of great insubordination. They insisted
upon marching to Madrid, that they might attack
the enemy there; an artillery officer was at
their head; and the guns were planted to prevent
the troops from proceeding in the direction
where they had been ordered. A difference of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
opinion among themselves prevented the execution
of this mad purpose; some were for
hastening to Despeñaperros, to take their post
in the passes of the Sierra Morena for the defence
of Andalusia. This afforded opportunity
for the General to reason with them, and pacify
them for a while. In consequence of this circumstance,
the difficulty which daily increased
of subsisting the troops, their increasing wants,
and the rapid desertions which were naturally
occasioned by privations, want of hope, and total
relaxation of discipline, Lapeña assembled his general
officers at Alcazar de Huete. The Duque
del Infantado, and Llamas, who had joined them
at Villarejo, were present at this council, and it
was determined, on Lapeña’s proposal, that the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Infantado chosen commander.
<span class="date">Dec. 9.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Duque should take the command. One reason
for appointing him was, that he was president of
the Council of Castille, and in that character was
entitled to require provisions and all things necessary
from the people, ... such being the respect
paid to the old authorities and established forms,
even at a time when necessity might have superseded
all laws, as paramount to all.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They retire to Cuenca.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>No command was ever accepted under more
painful and disheartening circumstances. The
troops were in a state of mutiny: the enemy
within three leagues, preparing to complete their
destruction; they had neither stores, supplies,
nor treasure, nor other means of obtaining any
than by the obedience which the people might
pay to his authority; and upon any panic which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
might seize the soldiers, or any suspicion that
should arise among them, the General would be
the first victim; it had too fatally been proved,
that no character, however unimpeached, no
services, however eminent, afforded any protection
against the ferocity of a deluded multitude.
With a full sense of these dangers, the Duke
accepted a command which it might have been
even more dangerous to refuse. His rank, his affable
manners, the part which he had taken against
the Prince of the Peace, and the share which he
was supposed to have had in bringing about the
downfall of that worthless minion, had made him
one of the most popular persons in Spain; and
though he had lost something by accompanying
Ferdinand on his miserable journey to Bayonne,
still he stood high in the opinion of the nation.
The new appointment was announced to the
army in a short proclamation; and the Central
Junta ratified it afterwards, approving Lapeña’s
resignation, and dispensing with an informality,
which the dangerous and peculiar state of things
rendered prudent. The immediate good which had
been expected from this measure was produced;
for the soldiers confided in their untried General,
and order was re-established among them. On
the 10th they entered Cuenca, there concluding
a retreat of nearly four hundred and fifty miles.
The position of that city enabled them to receive
supplies from La Mancha, Valencia, and Murcia;
there they rested for a while, discipline was restored,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
and three persons, who had been most
active in the mutiny, were brought to trial and
executed. The troops were clothed, funds were
raised for paying and supporting them, and hospitals
established. The stragglers having recovered
that strength, for want of which they
had fallen behind, rejoined their corps; new
levies were raised; and it was manifest that, notwithstanding
all their disasters, notwithstanding
the mighty power of the enemy, the treachery
of some leaders, and the misconduct of others,
which had been hardly less injurious, the spirit
of patriotism was still unimpaired, and the people,
by whom alone a country is to be saved, had not
abated one jot of heart or hope.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Arrival of the Conde de Alache’s corps.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Five days after their arrival they were joined
by a corps which it was supposed had been cut
off among the mountains of Rioja. The history
of its escape is equally honourable to the men
and to the Conde de Alache D. Miguel Lili,
who conducted them. They formed originally
a part of the army of Old Castille, under the
Conde de Cartaojal, which had been broken up
after the position of Logroño was lost. At the
end of October, Castaños stationed it along the
skirts of the Sierra de Cameros, extending from
in front of Logroño to Lodosa; the last division
of this force, which formed the left flank of the
army, was posted at Nalda under Lili. During
the first three weeks of November, this division
sustained repeated and almost daily attacks; varying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
its position as circumstances required, and
having, like Blake’s army, to endure the severest
privations; nevertheless it carried off fourteen
pieces of artillery, from Nalda to Ausejo and
Calahorra, in sight of the French, and by roads
which had been thought impracticable. On the
night of the 21st, Lili received intelligence that
a considerable force of the enemy had moved
from Logroño towards Ausejo; the next day he
learnt that the Spaniards, who were stationed
there and at Tudelilla, had fallen back upon their
right, and that 5000 French infantry and 1000
horse had moved from Najara, giving out that
they were going for Calahorra. He was thus
in imminent danger of being surrounded. Immediately
he left the banks of the Iregua, and
fell back to Venta de Codes, four leagues in the
rear of Nalda, where, in the course of the night,
a messenger from Cartaojal reached him with
instructions written at Tudelilla, on the 21st,
saying, that the French were in great force at
Ausejo, and that Castaños ordered him to retreat
by the Sierra to Agreda, whither Cartaojal himself
was going with all his troops to oppose the
French on the side of Almazan.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 23.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>For Agreda, therefore, Lili began his march
at daybreak. By two in the afternoon he had
reached Villar del Rio, five leagues from the
place which he had left, eight from that to which
he was bound; but here he met intelligence of
fresh disasters and new dangers. Agreda, it was
said, had already been abandoned by the Spaniards;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
1200 French cavalry, with a small body
of foot, were on their way to that town from
Soria, which had opened its gates to the enemy;
other columns from Soria and from Almazan
were to follow in the same direction. Fugitives
now arrived every hour, with tidings that the
enemy were sacking one place, or approaching
another, all their parties tending to the one point
of Agreda. Lili perceived, that if Cartaojal had
not already retired from that town, he inevitably
must, and that for himself, if he continued his
march, it would be to run into the midst of his
enemies. He did not hesitate, therefore, to disobey
orders which would have involved him in certain
destruction; and, acting upon his own judgement,
he marched the next morning in a contrary
direction, to Lumbreras, and the day afterwards
to Montenegro, thinking that a more defensible
point, and for the sake of receiving certain intelligence
from the side of Agreda. The report
that that town had been evacuated on the 23d
was premature; and Lili received a letter from
Cartaojal, written from thence on the 24th, and
regretting that he had fallen back to Lumbreras
upon erroneous information; to have joined him
at Agreda, he said, was the proper movement,
and almost the only means of safety; but it was
no time to consider what might have been done,
and, as things were, he must now follow his
own discretion, with that zeal which it was not
doubted he possessed. Whatever regret Lili
might have felt at receiving this reproof, was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
effectually counteracted by the report of the
messenger who brought it; for at the very moment
when Cartaojal dispatched him, news arrived
that the enemy were beginning to attack
the town. In fact, he was compelled speedily
to abandon it, and, marching by way of Borja to
Calatayud, joined the wreck of the army of the
centre, and accompanied them in their retreat.</p>

<p>Perilous as Lili’s situation now was, he had
yet to receive intelligence of events which rendered
it more desperate. On the 27th he learned
at Salas de los Infantes, by some stragglers who
had escaped from the action at Burgos, that that
capital was now in the hands of the French. His
spies brought him information, that the Intruder
was with a great force at Aranda; that the enemy
occupied all the bridges and fords of the Duero;
and that the Somosierra was threatened: finally,
to crown the distressing news of the day, a full
account reached him of the battle of Tudela. On
every side he was surrounded; to move in any
direction seemed equally perilous, and he was
utterly ignorant what course had been taken by
the relics of the army which he wished to join.
In these difficulties his first measure was to march
to Canales, four leagues from Salas, where, in
the very centre of the mountains, he might hope
to remain concealed from the enemy, or resist
them to the best advantage if he were attacked.
There, amid those difficult and inclement heights,
from whence the Arlanza flows toward Lerma,
the Duero toward the plains of Castille, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
Tiron, the Najerilla, and the Iregua toward
Rioja, he remained six days. During this time
he obtained sufficient intelligence of the movements
of the French to direct his own, and then
proceeded towards New Castille, in search of
Castaños’s broken army. On the 5th he reached
Quintanar de la Sierra, on the 6th San Leonardo.
His men travelled the whole of the following day
and night, and crossed the Duero at Berlanja.
On the 9th they entered Atienza, and here the
information which they found served only to occasion
new perplexity; for here Lili learned that
the central army had passed through, and been
pursued by the French; that they had afterwards
abandoned Guadalaxara and the heights of Santorcaz:
of their farther movements nothing was
known. Lili, however, considering all circumstances,
was convinced that they must have retreated
upon Cuenca, and he directed his march
towards the same point. On the 11th, at daybreak,
he crossed the great road from Zaragoza
to Madrid, at an opportune and happy hour,
passing between the last division of the French
and their rear-guard, then on the way from Calatayud;
and on the day that the Duke del Infantado
reached Cuenca, he arrived at Villar de
Domingo Garcia, from whence, on the 16th, he
passed to the head-quarters of the Commander.
During this whole retreat, which was over a tract
of nearly four hundred miles, through the most
difficult and untravelled ways, this corps had
constantly been surrounded by the enemy, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
were seldom more than ten or twelve miles distant
from them. Food they had none, but what
they could procure upon the way; most of the
men were barefoot, many of them nearly naked,
but their spirits never failed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat of the Central Junta from Aranjuez.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>If ever during the contest there was a time
when Spain might have been irretrievably subjected,
it was now, if a dissolution of the government
had taken place. The Central Junta had
been slow in perceiving the danger, but when it
came upon them they acted with promptitude
and wisdom. Before they left Aranjuez a commission
of six members was appointed to transact
business during their journey, and official
intelligence of their removal was communicated
to the foreign ministers. Their escort was so
insufficient, that a small body of cavalry might
have surprised them; they travelled in parties,
but assembled at Talavera; three members were
left there to collect and re-organize the soldiers
who were coming in great numbers to that point.
From thence proceeding to Truxillo, there they
again met, dispatched orders to the provinces,
and sent some of their own members to those
places where they might be most useful. That
city afforded an opportunity of reconsidering
where they should fix their abode, whether at
Badajoz, as had been determined, or at Cordoba,
the road to either place being open: Seville was
preferred to either, and they assembled there on
the 17th of December. Before this removal it had
been concerted by Jovellanos, with some members<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
of the Royal Council and of the Council of the
Indies, that eleven members of the former, and
nine of the latter, including their presidents,
should follow the Central Junta, and with two
members from each of the other tribunals, form
a <i xml:lang="es" lang="es">Consejo reunido</i>, or united Council. The other
members were commanded to leave Madrid, and
retire either to their own places of abode in the
provinces, or whither they would, there to receive
their salaries, assist the government with their
advice and services when called upon, and promote
by all means in their power the national
cause. Too many of these persons were found
wanting in the hour of trial, some in weakness
submitting to the Intruder rather than endure
the ills of honourable poverty, others taking an
active and infamous part in his service. The proposed
Council was formed of those who repaired
to Seville; and those who, from whatever cause,
arrived at a later time, found from the Junta an
indulgence which would not have been granted
them by the people, less charitable, and perhaps
less just; they were received with respect, and
their salaries continued to them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Their address to the people of Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The agents of the Intruder knowing how desirable
for their views it would be to bring the
national government into disrepute, reported
that the Junta had sanctioned and approved the
capitulation of the capital. This the Junta contradicted
in a manly proclamation, and they exhorted
the inhabitants of Madrid to bear in mind
that the temporary occupation of their buildings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
by the enemy was of little moment, while he was
not master of their hearts. “Continue to resist
him,” said they, “in the very bosom of your
families; place no confidence in the promises of
the French; remember that they have promised
happiness to every people, and have made every
people miserable. Keep alive your hope, retain
your fortitude, and your deliverance will be glorious
in proportion to the greatness of the danger
which you have encountered.” They made no
attempt to conceal the extent of their disasters;
but they attributed them to the inexperience of
their troops, and denied that the monarchy was
comprehended within the narrow precincts of the
metropolis. “Were you to believe the enemy,”
said they, “our armies have vanished like the
smoke of the battle, and Spain has neither forces
wherewith to oppose her invaders, nor authority
to regulate her councils, nor resources to save her
from destruction. All this is false. The government
which has been chosen by the people never
attracted more respect, never felt more strongly
the strong principle of union, and never found
more ardour in the public cause. The provinces
have redoubled their exertions at its voice, and
new enlistments, new contributions, and new
sacrifices have already filled the void occasioned
by our losses.” A splendid instance of patriotism
in one of the nobles was at this time made public;
the Duke of Medina Sidonia, whose property had
just been confiscated in Madrid by the intrusive
government, had from the commencement of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
struggle made a free gift every month of 2500
dollars, in addition to his share of the public
burthens, and to various donations of necessaries
for the army.</p>

<p>While the Junta was making exertions which
were well seconded by the zeal of the people,
the whole of those extensive plains, which form
the centre or table-land of Spain, lay at the mercy
of the invaders. On the 11th of December Victor
had his detachments in Aranjuez and in Ocaña;

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French enter Toledo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

on the 19th he occupied Toledo. The surrender
of this ancient and famous city, after its professions
of determined patriotism, was one of
those circumstances for which the Spaniards
were reproached, by those who had depreciated
their exertions, and despaired of their cause.
Yet if the Toledans did not signalize themselves
by heroic sacrifices, like the Zaragozans, there
was no want of a right spirit, nor had they been
deficient in their duty. In the spring of the preceding
year Dupont and Vedel entered that city
with their divisions, and raised a most oppressive
contribution. But no sooner had they proceeded
on their way to Andalusia, than a Junta was
formed, consisting of the most respectable citizens:
they could not raise forces themselves,
being surrounded by the enemy, and having no
military means; but they ordered as many of the
districts in that kingdom as could exert themselves
to act under the instructions of the Junta
of Badajoz; they contributed large sums of
money; and they refused obedience to four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
successive orders which enjoined them to proclaim
the Intruder, though it was announced,
that, if they continued in their disobedience,
5000 French would come, and perform the ceremony
sword in hand. The evacuation of Madrid
relieved them from this danger. And when the
victorious army of Castaños was on its way to
the capital, Toledo supported 10,000 men of that
army for three weeks, made a donation of 300,000
reales to them on their departure, equipped many
of their officers, and clothed a great proportion of
the men. This was not all. In two months it
raised and equipped two regiments of infantry,
and a corps of 700 horse; for which funds were
raised by a subscription, all persons, from the
archbishop to the poorest peasant, contributing
according to their means. The university also
raised a corps of students; and after the siege of
Zaragoza the pectoral of the archbishop, valued
at 150,000 reales, was converted into money to
relieve the inhabitants of that heroic city. After
the defeat at Burgos, the Toledans applied to
government for arms to defend their walls. This
was the mode of warfare to which the Junta, if
they had rightly understood the nature of their
own strength, should have resorted; and this
system of defence was advised by the English
ambassador, Mr. Frere, than whom no man
judged more generously, nor more wisely, of
the Spanish character and the Spanish cause.
But this essential precaution had been neglected;
and when the Toledans applied for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
artillery and ammunition, disaster followed so
close upon disaster, that there was no leisure
for attending to their request, urgent as it was.
What then could be done? They sent off their
moveable property to Seville; 12,000 swords also
were dispatched to the same place, from that
fabric which for so many centuries has been
famous, and which probably owes its original
celebrity to workmen from Damascus. The
Junta, the legitimate authorities, and all the
most distinguished inhabitants, left the city;
neither the threats nor promises of the Intruder
could induce them to return: they retired to the
free part of the peninsula, submitting to poverty
with that dignified composure which resulted
from the consciousness of having discharged
their duty. This was the fate of the parents,
while their sons, in the corps of students, fought
and bled for the independence of Spain. It is
plain, therefore, that though the gates of Toledo
were opened to the enemy, that same spirit still
existed within its walls which, during the war
of the Commons of Castille, rendered it the last
hold of Spanish liberty.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Defence of Villacañas.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From Toledo, from Aranjuez, and from Ocaña,
parties of French cavalry overran the open and
defenceless plains of lower La Mancha, foraging
and plundering the towns and villages with impunity
as far as Manzanares. The La Manchans,
relying, like the government, too confidently
upon the resistance which regular armies and
the modes of regular warfare could oppose to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
such a military power as that of France, had
made no preparations for defending themselves;
some places were deserted by the inhabitants; all
left open to the enemy, who scoured the country
at their pleasure. The little townlet of Villacañas
afforded a single and honourable exception.
A party of 60 horse entered it on the night of
the 20th of December, being a detachment from
a much larger force which had quartered itself
in Tembleque. The people caught up such arms
as they could find, and drove the invaders out;
they began immediately to dig trenches and throw
up barricadoes, ... the adjoining peasantry came
to their assistance, ... a few persons of high quality
fled; but, with these few exceptions, the utmost
zeal and alacrity were displayed by all ranks,
and ready obedience was paid to some old soldiers,
who took upon themselves the command.
During five successive days the French renewed
their attacks, and were constantly repulsed; their
plundering parties had no artillery with them,
and the means of defence, therefore, as long as
the Spaniards took care not to expose themselves
to a charge of horse in the open country, were
equal to those of attack. Weary at length of repeated
failures, and unwilling to incur farther
loss in an object of no other value than what the
plunder of the place might be worth, the French
desisted from any farther attempts, and Villacañas
remained safe and uninjured, while all the
country round was ransacked. The example was
deservedly thought of such importance, that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span>
whole details of this little siege were published
by the government in an extraordinary gazette.
Whatever contributions were due to the state
by the inhabitants of this townlet were remitted
to them, and those persons who had taken the
lead were rewarded by other privileges. “This,”
said the government, “is the kind of war which
our perfidious enemy feareth most, and which is
the most advantageous for ourselves. Let the
people of every village arm themselves, entrench
themselves in their very houses, break up the
roads, lay ambushes upon every height and pass,
intercept his provisions, cut off his communications,
and make him perceive that at every step
he will find the most obstinate resistance. Thus
we shall waste his forces; thus we shall show to
the world that a great and generous nation is
not to be insulted with impunity, not to be conquered
when it fights for its king, for its liberty,
and for its religion.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparations for defending the Sierra Morena.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Meantime the Juntas of Ciudad Real, (the
capital of Upper La Mancha,) and of the four
kingdoms of Jaen, Granada, Cordoba, and Seville,
which compose the province of Andalusia, formed
a Central Assembly in La Carolina, where two
deputies from each province met to consult upon
speedy measures for fortifying the gorge of Despeñaperros,
this pass of the Sierra Morena being
considered as the Thermopylæ, where the progress
of this new barbarian might be withstood.
Here an army was necessary, and there was none:
the Marques de Palacio was sent by the Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
Junta to form one under his command. The
Juntas of Andalusia and La Mancha raised new
levies; and officers and men who had deserted
from the central army, many of them scattering
alarm and sedition where they fled, re-entered
into this new establishment. The marine battalions
and brigades of artillery were ordered
hither from Cadiz, leaving only 300 men in that
city, besides the volunteers. Fourteen pieces of
cannon had been fortunately stopped at Manzanares,
on their way to Madrid. These were
now mounted upon the works which were thrown
up to defend this important position. Another
road also, by which the enemy might have passed
the Sierra, was occupied by a detachment of 500
men. Before the middle of December, 6000 foot
and 300 horse had assembled at La Carolina, and
their number increased daily. But it was not
towards the Sierra Morena that Buonaparte was
looking; his attention was chiefly fixed upon the
English army, and the road by which he thought
to reach Andalusia was through Extremadura,
hoping to overtake the Supreme Junta in their
flight; having reached them at Truxillo, his
armies might divide, one marching to take possession
of Lisbon, the other to take vengeance
for Dupont at Seville and Cadiz.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Murder of San Juan at Talavera.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There was no force in Extremadura which
could oppose any obstacle to this plan. When
the pass of Somosierra was lost, San Juan, who
commanded there, cut his way sword in hand
through a squadron of Poles, and by by-roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
reached Segovia, where he found the troops who
had retired from Sepulveda. From thence he
marched to Guadarrama, united with the Extremaduran
troops under General Heredia, and descended
to the Escurial, because he was without
provisions in the pass. There they received
orders to hasten to Madrid, and enter that city
by the gate of Segovia. On the way exaggerated
reports were spread of the strength of the enemy;
suspicion increased the insubordination of the soldiers;
the artillery and baggage-men forsook their
charge and fled, and several corps broke up. The
whole of Heredia’s van-guard dispersed in this
manner, in spite of all San Juan’s efforts to detain
them; they would rally, they said, at Talavera:
this word went through the army, and served as
a pretext for every one who chose to fly. The
two generals had only a handful of men with
them when they approached Madrid, and then
they discovered that the city had been betrayed.
No other course remained for them than to repair
to Talavera, in the hope of rallying what
would still form a considerable force. The rabble
of the army, sufficiently faithful to their appointment,
bent their way to that city, plundering as
they went along; and there San Juan met them,
unhappily for himself. The wretches who had
been foremost in subverting discipline, and instigating
the troops to break up, began to apprehend
punishment if the army should again
assume a regular form; and this was likely to
be the case immediately, for many thousands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
(many having escaped from Madrid) were now
collected there, and the government had already
begun to take measures for re-equipping them.
It was easy for these villains to raise a cry against
San Juan: all men knew the importance of the
position at Somosierra; but there were few who
knew with what insufficient means the general
had been supplied. Mobs never reason, least of
all when they are under the influence of fear;
and the Spanish troops had suffered so much
from incapacity, that when any person was denounced
as a traitor, it seemed like a relief to
themselves, and an act of justice to their country,
to vent their vengeance upon him. The cry
against San Juan became general: a friar went
at the head of a party to the convent of the
Augustines, where he had taken up his quarters,
and they cried out that they were come to put

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Benito San Juan to death. San Juan attempted
to expostulate, but in vain. He drew his sword
to defend himself, and immediately he was
pierced with their bullets. The rabble dragged
the body to a gibbet, and hung it there; next
they sought for Heredia, that they might kill
him also; but he eluded their search. As soon
as their fury was allayed, the instigators of these
excesses secured themselves by flight; and the
troops, who had been misled, perceived the consequences
of their lawless conduct. If San Juan
had indeed been a traitor, they felt that they
ought to have delivered him up to the proper
tribunal; ... by taking vengeance into their own
hands they had made themselves obnoxious to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
laws. Whom too could they trust, whom were
they to obey? Instead, therefore, of forming a
new army, as they had designed, at Talavera,
they dispersed again, not having now any rallying
place appointed, but each man going whither
he thought best. Some took the road to Andalusia,
some to Avila: the Extremadurans, who
were the most numerous, went to their homes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Edict against deserters.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The dispersion of the soldiers called forth a
severe edict. It began by stating, that the martial
laws of Spain had affixed no punishment for
officers who deserted their colours or stations, it
never having been supposed that men of such
rank could possibly be guilty of such a crime.
But now it had unhappily been seen that many
officers, forgetful of all honour and duty, had
fled, scattering disorder and terror wherever they
went, and pretending treason in their generals
as an excuse for their own conduct; whereas
they themselves had been the worst enemies of
their country, by abandoning their generals in
the most critical moments. The Junta, therefore,
pronounced sentence of death against every
officer who absented himself from his colours
without permission, and confiscation of his property
for the relief of the widows and orphans
of soldiers in his parish. Soldiers were made
liable to the like penalty; any person who harboured
a deserter was to be punished by confiscation
of his property, and the same penalty was
denounced against all magistrates who suffered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_451">451</span>
deserters to remain within their jurisdiction. But
all who, within fifteen days, should present themselves
to the nearest authority in order to rejoin
the army, were exempted from the pains in this
decree.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>A few English stragglers butchered by the French cavalry.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Four days after the murder of San Juan, and
the dispersion of his army, two divisions of French
cavalry, under Milhaud and Lasalle, entered Talavera.
They found the body of the Spanish General
still on the gibbet, and this murder furnished
Buonaparte with a new subject of invective against
the Spaniards; though this, and the thousand
deaths, and all the untold crimes, and all the unutterable
miseries with which the peninsula was
filled, were the consequences of his own single
conduct, the fruits of his individual wickedness.
Lasalle fell in with sixteen Englishmen upon the
road, stragglers from General Hope’s detachment,
and it was related in the bulletins<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> of
Buonaparte, as an exploit worthy of remembrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
and commendation, that a division of French
cavalry, falling in with sixteen Englishmen who
had lost their way, put them to the sword. This
was but a small part of the force which was
destined to proceed in this direction. As soon
as Madrid had been delivered up, Lefebvre was
ordered to advance from Valladolid towards Lisbon.
First he advanced to Segovia, which he
entered unresisted. The people were dispirited
by the panic and flight of their armies; but it
should not be forgotten for their exculpation, that
the more generous and heroic spirits, having
flocked to their country’s standard among the
foremost levies, had already received their crown
of martyrdom, or were clinging to the wreck of
the two great armies of the north and the centre,
or were consummating the sacrifice of duty in
Zaragoza. In one place only between Valladolid
and the capital did this part of the French army
experience any opposition. The pass of Guadarrama
was open to them: General Hope had
been stationed there, but was recalled by Sir
John Moore, and there were no native troops
to supply his place. But when the enemy descended

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French take possession of the Escurial.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

upon the Escurial, and proceeded to
take possession of that palace, the magnificent
monument of a victory which Spain had achieved
over France in open, honourable war, and in a
fair field, they found the peasantry assembled to
defend the seat and sepulchres of their kings.
Undisciplined as they were, ill-armed, and with
none to direct their efforts, they stood their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
ground till they were overpowered by practised
troops, superior in numbers as well as in arms;
and the French, after the slaughter of these
brave peasants before the gates, took up their
quarters in the palace of the Philips. He who
founded that stately pile, could he then have
beheld from his grave what was passing around
him, would have seen the consequences of that
despotic system which he and his father established
upon the ruins of the old free constitution
of Spain.</p>

<p>It was a noble feeling which led these peasants
to sacrifice themselves in defence of the Escurial,
and the action did not pass unnoticed by those
able and enlightened Spaniards whose patriotic
writings at this time did honour to themselves
and to their country. “Nothing,” said Don
Isidro de Antillon, “is more worthy of public
interest, and nothing will more excite the admiration
of posterity, than a deed like this. If
indeed we had only armies to oppose to Buonaparte,
infallibly we should become his slaves;
the victory would be the usurper’s beyond all
resource. But it is the collective strength of our
inhabited places, the defence of our walls, the
obstinate and repeated resistance of the people
in the streets and gateways, along the roads and
upon the heights, wherever they can cut off or
annoy the detachments of the enemy, ... the universal
spirit of insurrection, now become as it
were the very element of our existence; this it
is which disconcerts his plans, which renders his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
victories useless, and after a thousand vicissitudes
and disasters, will finally establish the independence
and the glory of Spain.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Excesses of the French.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Lefebvre entered Madrid on the 8th of December.
Buonaparte reviewed his division in the
Prado, and dispatched it to Toledo, while Sebastiani
with another division marched for Talavera.
In that city, by the 19th, about 25,000
French were assembled, including 5000 cavalry.
The wiser inhabitants fled before their arrival,
preferring the miseries of emigration to the insults
and atrocities which they must otherwise
have endured: for the exaction of heavy contributions,
which reduced half the people to
beggary, was the least evil those towns endured
that fell under the yoke of the French. Every
where the soldiers were permitted to plunder;
no asylum could secure the women from their unrestrained
brutality; churches and convents were
profaned with as little compunction as dwelling-houses
were broken open; and in many instances,
the victims were exposed naked in the streets.
The Spanish government exclaimed loudly against
these enormities. “In other times,” they said,
“war was carried on between army and army,
soldier and soldier; their fury spent itself upon
the field of battle; and when courage, combined
with fortune, had decided the victory, the conquerors
behaved to the conquered like men of
honour, and the defenceless people were respected.
The progress of civilization had tempered
the evils of hostility, till a nation which so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_455">455</span>
lately boasted that it was the most polished in
the world, renewed, in the 19th century, the
cruelty of the worst savages, and all the horrors
which make us tremble in perusing the history
of the irruptions of the barbarians of old. Like
tygers, these enemies make no distinction in
their carnage, ... the aged, the infants, the women,
... all are alike to them, wherever they can find
blood to shed.”</p>

<p>This appeal could be of no avail against a
tyrant who, in the very origin of the war, had
shown himself dead to all sense of justice, humanity,
and even of honour, which sometimes
supplies their place; nor against generals and
officers who could serve him in such a cause.
Such men could be taught humanity only by the
severest retaliation. The language which the government
addressed to their own subjects might
be more effectual. “What resource have you,”
said they, “in submission and in cowardice? If
by this abasement you could purchase a miserable
existence, that perhaps with base minds might
exculpate you. But you fly to your houses to
perish in them, or to be idle spectators of the
horrors which these ruffian soldiers are preparing
for you! Yes! wait for them there, and they will
not tarry long ere they come and shed before
your eyes the blood of the innocent victims whom
you will not defend. Old fathers, wretched
mothers, prepare to receive your daughters released
from the arms of an hundred barbarians
only when they are in the act of death! or if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
they recover life, to curse it in the bitterness of
unextinguishable shame; tell them to reproach
those cowardly husbands, those base lovers, who
are content to live, and see them plunged in
this abominable infamy. But they will not be
suffered to live; hand-cuffed and haltered, they
will be dragged out of their country; they will
be made soldiers by force, though they would
not become so from honour and a sense of duty;
there they will be exposed in the foremost ranks
to the fire of the enemy; there they will not be
able to fly; ... the toil, the danger, and death will
be theirs; the glory and the spoil will be their
conquerors’, and the crowns which they win will
be for the tyrant, the cause of all this misery.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galluzo collects the fugitives in Extremadura.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It had been happy for Spain if the government
had always acted as energetically as it wrote;
but it should be remembered in justice to the
Spaniards, that the dispersion of the troops was
in many instances an act of self-preservation, so
utterly were they left without supplies of food
or clothing, by the inexperience and incompetence
of every military department. Even against
the testimony and the reproaches of its own government,
the Spanish nation stands acquitted.
Never did men suffer more patiently, or fight
more bravely, than Blake’s army. There was no
want of courage at Tudela; and of the remains
of the army which fought there, a large proportion
was at this very time defending Zaragoza
with a heroism unexampled in modern times,
upon any other soil. Wherever, indeed, a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
army was to be collected, soldiers were not wanting.
After San Juan’s death, Galluzo was appointed
to the command; he took his post at
the bridge of Almaraz to defend the left bank
of the Tagus; and in a few days had collected
about 8000 soldiers, ... many of them were without
arms, ... most of them barefooted, and now
unhappily accustomed to flight and desertion.
Nevertheless they assembled; for every man felt
individually brave, and it was only the want of
discipline, which, by preventing them from feeling
confidence collectively, made panic contagious
in the moment of danger. The province
of Extremadura immediately provided money for
these troops; this province, though the least
populous in the peninsula, had particularly distinguished
itself by its exertions; it had raised
and equipped, wholly at its own expense, 24,000
men, and had supplied ammunition and arms of
every kind from Badajoz to the other provinces.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He prepares for the defence of the Tagus.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>There are four bridges between Talavera and
the confluence of the Tietar with the Tagus;
the Puente del Arzobispo, or the Archbishop’s,
the Puente del Conde, or the Count’s, the bridge
of Almaraz, and the Puente del Cardinal, or
the Cardinal’s. With his present feeble and inefficient
force Galluzo had no other means of
protecting Extremadura than by breaking down,
or defending these bridges; if he could effect
this, the province would be secure from an attack
on the side of Talavera. Almaraz was the
most important of these points; here he planted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span>
ten pieces of cannon and two mortars, and
stationed 5000 men. The more surely to prevent
the enemy from winning the passage he
mined the bridge; but so firmly had this noble
pile been built, that when the mine was fired,
the explosion only served to injure it without
rendering it impassable. Don Francisco Trias
was sent with 850 men to the Puente del Arzobispo;
on his way he met the engineer, who had
previously been dispatched to break it down,
but who had been prevented from attempting it
by the enemy, so that this bridge was already in
their power. Trias, therefore, took his position
with the view of checking the incursions of the
French on this side, and ordered Don Antonio
Puig, with such assistants as he could procure
from the magistrates of Talavera la Vieja, to
destroy the Puente del Conde, and provide for
the defence of that point, and of three fords upon
the same part of the river. When this officer
arrived he had neither a single soldier under his
command, nor arms for the peasantry; the latter
want was soon supplied; the peasantry were
zealous, and some of the stragglers joined him.</p>

<p>The bridge of the Cardinal was assigned to the
keeping of a battalion of Walloon Guards and a
squadron of the volunteers of Extremadura, under
Brigadier Don Francisco Durasmiel. Galluzo
also stationed his reserve at Jaraicejo, under Brigadier
Don Josef Vlazquez Somosa, and sent
another field officer to Truxillo to collect and
organize the stragglers who might either voluntarily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span>
join him, or be detained by the patroles.
While the General was making these dispositions
for the defence of the province, the Junta
of Badajoz made the greatest exertions to supply
the wants of this new army, and its efforts were
well seconded by the Extremaduran people. Half
a million of reales was raised in loans and free
gifts within a week; all the cloth of Torremocha
and of other clothing towns was applied to the
use of the army, ... no other work was carried
on in the monastery of Guadalupe than that of
making earthen vessels for their cookery; and
commissaries were sent to the sixteen villages
nearest the bridge of Almaraz to see that rations
of bread for 5000 men were daily delivered there.
These measures were so effectual, that the troops
were soon comfortably clothed, and after the first
day they had no want of any thing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French cross the river.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was, however, scarcely to be hoped that so
small and ill-compacted a force could maintain
its ground, in a country which offered them no
advantages for defence against such an army as
the French had assembled in Talavera. After
some skirmishes with the advanced guard at Almaraz,
and some slight attacks upon the Puente
del Conde, which were designed chiefly to keep
the Spaniards on the alarm, and divert their attention
from the side where the real attack was
intended, Sebastiani crossed the Puente del Arzobispo
on the 24th of December, and attacked
Trias in front and on his right flank with superior
numbers. The Spaniards did not yield till after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
a vigorous resistance; and then retreated by the
Sierra to Castanar de Ibor. On the same day,
about two hours after noon, the Puente del Conde
was attacked, and the fords. The bridge was
bravely defended by Don Pablo Murillo, whose
distinguished talents were now first displayed.
Puig guarded the fords, and they repelled the
enemy every where till night; when, being informed
of the defeat of Trias, and that Sebastiani
had proceeded by Peralera de Garbin and Bohonal
towards Almaraz, Puig perceiving that he must
be taken in the rear if he continued in his present
position, retreated to Peralera de Garbin
behind the French, and from thence to Castanar
de Ibor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galluzo retreats to Jaraicejo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The news of these disasters reached Galluzo
at night. Immediately he apprehended that the
object of the enemy, who were marching by Valdecasa,
Valdecañas, and other points, to Romangordo
and Miravete, was to cut off the retreat of
his whole division. To prevent this he ordered
all the artillery, except four pieces, which formed
a battery on the left of the bridge, to retire
with the main force to Jaraicejo, for which place
he himself set off at midnight with his Aide-de-camps
and the cavalry, leaving three companies
in charge of the remaining battery under Captain
Don Xavier de Hore. This officer was attacked
on the following morning by the French; the
battery was ill-placed, and Hore perceived that
the ammunition-carts were within reach of the
enemy’s fire. He ordered them to be removed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
behind a bank which would shelter them; ... the
muleteers were no sooner out of his sight, than
they cut the traces, and fled with their beasts,
imitating the conduct of some infantry who took
to flight. The enemy soon made themselves
masters of the bridge and the battery, and secured
some prisoners, ... though but few; for
before the French could lay planks over the
broken bridge, and pass in sufficient number,
most of the Spaniards effected their escape, and
afterwards rejoined the General at Miajadas.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Dispersion of his army.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Galluzo’s first thought was to make a stand at
Jaraicejo, and with this intent he dispatched
orders to General Henestrosa to join him from
Truxillo with all the troops which he had collected,
and requested the Junta to supply him
with as large a force of armed peasantry as
possible. But no sooner did he learn that the
bridge of Almaraz had been forced, than he gave
up this purpose, and resolved to fall back upon
Truxillo, apprehending that the enemy might
intercept his retreat. His apprehension degenerated
into panic, when false intelligence was
brought him that the French had entered Deleitosa,
a village something less than eight miles
to the south-east. This intelligence was followed
by other reports equally false and more alarming,
which the knavish and the traitorous invented,
and the fearful and the suspicious easily
believed. The retreat had been begun in perfect
order, but the army, before it reached Truxillo,
was in a state of total disorganization. Galluzo,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
confounded at the first approach of danger, (for
if he had deliberately resolved to attempt resistance,
the pass of Miravete would have been the
place which he would have chosen, after the
bridge was forced,) called a council of war; it
was agreed that the defence of Extremadura was
no longer possible, and that he should retreat
into Andalusia. A chapel, which had been converted
into a powder magazine, was now blown
up, that it might not fall into the hands of the
enemy. The explosion, and the preparations
which were made for further flight, excited the
utmost terror in the inhabitants of Truxillo, and
their lamentations increased the confusion and
alarm of the soldiers. It now became a rout; ...
most of the troops deserted, plundering the towns
and villages through which they passed. Those
who still followed the General were no longer
under any restraint; they went through Miajadas,
Medellin, and Quintania, and in four days
reached Zalamea, above an hundred miles from
Jaraicejo. Here it had been appointed to halt,
and here Galluzo found himself with not more
than a thousand men. Nothing could be worse
than the conduct of the men during their flight;
... some sold their muskets, ... some threw them
away, ... houses were broken open, and upon one
individual a piece of church plate was found, ...
a species of robbery which excites peculiar horror
in Spain. The officers, instead of endeavouring
to restrain these excesses, were some of them
active themselves in pillage; it is probable, indeed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
that had they done their duty, the men
would have discharged theirs; for those officers
to whom the more difficult task of bringing off
the artillery had been entrusted, and who were
therefore picked men, effected their object:
though without an escort, they lost only two
pieces of cannon, and carried seventeen to Miajadas,
... from whence part were sent to Badajoz,
the rest followed Galluzo to Zalamea. Trias also
effected a far more dangerous retreat than his
commander in good order. He set forward from
Castanar for Fresnedoso, and when within a mile
of the place, learnt that the French were there,
having won the bridge of Almaraz. He had now
to tread back his steps, and endeavour to reach
Jaraicejo. After a day’s march he found that the
French were there also, and making for Truxillo,
again discovered the enemy in possession of the
place to which he was bound. Nevertheless he
preserved discipline in his little troop, and that
preserved confidence; instead of losing his men
by desertion, he collected stragglers as he went,
and arrived at Zalamea with a larger force than
Galluzo himself had brought there.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Galluzo is superseded by Cuesta.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the incapacity of Galluzo was thus decidedly
manifested, it had been in agitation to
remove him from the command, and appoint
Cuesta in his place. This General, as an arrested
person, followed the Junta on their retreat from
Aranjuez. It so happened, that while he was at
Merida, some soldiers belonging to the scattered
army of Extremadura gathered together in that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
city, and the owner of the house in which Cuesta
lodged persuaded them to demand him for their
leader, as it were by acclamation. The Junta of
Merida upon this sent up a representation to the
Central Junta, requesting that Cuesta might be
appointed to the command. It was replied, that
this ought not to be done without the approbation
of the Junta of Badajoz, which had made
such signal exertions in the patriotic cause, and
was not willing to supersede Galluzo, whom it
had appointed. But now, after this disorderly
flight, he was immediately deprived of the command,
and put under arrest, and Cuesta was
nominated to succeed him. Cuesta’s errors were
overlooked, because no doubt of his motives was
entertained; and at a time when the cry of treachery
once raised against a commander was sufficient
to break up an army, it was an object of
considerable importance to find a leader in whom
the men would confide. At this moment the whole
of Extremadura to the very walls of Badajoz was
open to the enemy, and the Junta trembled for
Seville. Brigadier Don Josef Serrano Valdenebro
was sent with as many men as he could collect
to guard Santa Olaya and El Ronquillo, in the
western passes of the Sierra Morena, and co-operate
with Cuesta in covering Andalusia on
that side. These means of defence would have
been as ineffectual as they were feeble, if Buonaparte
had not thought it of more importance at
this time to drive the English out of Spain, than
to pursue his victories in the south.</p>

they have desolated with their intrigues, their
monopolies, and their frightful selfishness! Oh,

the evils, all the plagues, which can afflict the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
human race, come from London.” He represented
the Spaniards as complaining that the
English had given them arms, powder, and
clothing, but had sent troops only to excite

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>14th Bulletin.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

them, lead them astray, and forsake them in the
hour of danger, when 40,000 British at Espinosa
or Tudela might have balanced the fortune of
the war.... That number of British troops would
at either place have turned it.</p>

<p>Great Britain possessed at that time men,
means, and generals equal to any service; but
the nation did not yet understand its own
strength, nor had the government yet learnt
either to direct it wisely, or to make exertions
commensurate to the end whereat they aimed.
The lessons which books and history might teach
had been neglected, and experience therefore was
to be purchased at a heavy price.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The British army from Portugal enters Spain.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>As soon as the campaign in Portugal was ended,
Sir Hew Dalrymple began to prepare for entering
Spain: on the 6th of October Sir John Moore received
his appointment to the command; the preparations
meantime had not been relaxed, and in
eight days afterward part of the troops were in
motion. Difficulties and doubts had occurred at
the very outset. The infantry were to go either
by sea or land at the Commander’s discretion;
the voyage at that season was thought too precarious;
and the Junta represented, that if they
went by sea, half the army would be unable to
leave the coast for want of necessaries, there
being scarcely means at Coruña for forwarding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
10,000 men who were to land there under Sir
David Baird, and join the Commander wherever
he should appoint. The land-journey therefore
having been chosen, the Spanish Commissary-General
was consulted concerning the means of
subsisting the army on the great road by Elvas;
but the quantity of meat which was required
astonished him; and he computed that in three
months all the oxen in the country would be
consumed, and very few hogs left. There was
no want of food in the north of Portugal, but it
was said that artillery could not be transported
across the mountains. British officers were sent
to examine the roads, and they confirmed this
assertion of the natives. It was ascertained when
too late, that bad as the ways were, they were
practicable for cannon; but in consequence of
this error, it was deemed necessary to divide the
army, and this led to serious evils. General
Hope, with the artillery, cavalry, and four regiments
of foot, was to go by the Madrid road;
General Paget, with two brigades, by Elvas and
Alcantara. The rest of the army moved through
Almeida; two brigades, under General Beresford,
by way of Coimbra; three, under General
Fraser, by Abrantes, crossing the Tagus there,
and recrossing at Villa Velha, ... a point which,
in former wars, has been considered the key to
Lisbon. These were to unite at Salamanca, and
General Hope and Sir David Baird to join them
either there or at Valladolid.</p>

<p>If the people of England had been required to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
name the general who should be employed on
this important occasion, Sir John Moore would
certainly have been their choice, so generally
was he respected as an officer and as a man.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Former services of Sir John Moore.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

He was born at Glasgow in 1760. From the
eighteenth to the twenty-third year of his age
he was on the continent with his father (a physician
and a distinguished man of letters, then
travelling with the young Duke of Hamilton),
and soon afterwards rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel
in the army. He served with
distinction in Corsica, the West Indies, the
Helder expedition, and in Egypt; had often
been wounded, and given proofs of professional
skill as well as of personal gallantry, for he was
fond of his profession, and had studied it well.
But the constitution of his mind led him to look
at the dark rather than the hopeful aspect of
things; and it was his farther misfortune to have
imbibed that exaggerated opinion of the French
as a military people, the ability of their Generals,
and the consummate wisdom of their
Emperor, which the enemies of government in
England were always labouring to produce, for
the purpose of humbling the spirit of their
country.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>His care to maintain discipline.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the troops began their march Sir John
Moore warned them in his general orders that the
Spaniards were a grave, orderly people, extremely
sober, but generous, and easily offended by any
insult or disrespect; he exhorted them to accommodate
themselves to these manners, to meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
with equal kindness the cordiality wherewith
they would be received, and not shock by their
intemperance a people worthy of their attachment,
whose efforts they were come to support
in the most glorious cause. His resolution to
maintain order and proper discipline was farther
evinced by punishing a marauder upon the march
with death: the offender was one whose character
gave no hope of amendment, and the General
took that opportunity of declaring his determination
to show no mercy to plunderers or marauders,
in other words, to thieves and villains. Farther
to gratify the Spaniards, the army, upon entering
Spain, were ordered to wear the red cockade
in addition to their own.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ill prospect of affairs when he arrives at Salamanca.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On Nov. 13, Sir John arrived with his advanced
guard at Salamanca. Before he entered the city,
he learnt the defeat of the Extremaduran army
at Burgos, and on the second night after his
arrival, was awakened by an express, with news
that the French had possession of Valladolid, ...
twenty leagues distant. He had only three
brigades of infantry with him, and not a single
gun. His first thought was to fall back upon
Ciudad Rodrigo; but he soon learnt that the
French had retired to Palencia, and that none of
their infantry had advanced beyond Burgos: he
therefore sent orders to Generals Baird and
Hope, to concentrate their divisions, and join
him with all speed. Every day now brought
with it intelligence of new disasters. Blake’s army
was dispersed, and Buonaparte might either turn
his force against Castaños, or march against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
English, to prevent their junction. He, meantime,
placed nearly in the centre, between two
divisions of his army, which were approaching
from different points, was compelled to remain
inactive. Perceiving what he thought the supineness
of the Spanish government, and indignant
at discovering the weakness of the Spaniards, he
began to despair of their cause. He saw nothing
around him but an inactivity, which he mistook
for torpor and indifference. They had not, he
said, shown themselves a wise or a provident
people; their wisdom was not a wisdom of action.
Yet still he felt that they were a fine people; that
they had a character of their own, quite distinct
from that of any other nation; and much, he
thought, might have been done with them. He
erred in thinking that they would not do much
for themselves.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir David Baird arrives at Astorga.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir David Baird had formed a like opinion.
The expedition under his command reached
Coruña on the 13th of October; and such were the
idle forms and the negligence of the Spanish authorities,
that the troops were kept on ship-board
till an order for their landing could be received
from the Central Junta. This General had been
accustomed to an Indian army, with its train of
slaves and sutlers, elephants and palanquins; he
had now to march through a country where it is
not without difficulty that a party of travellers
can obtain food, and which had already been
drained by its own troops; and his commissaries
were not only inexperienced in the business of
their department, but ignorant of the language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
of the people. Dividing his army into small
detachments, which followed each other at considerable
distance, he arrived at Astorga, Nov.
19th, and there learning the defeat of Blake’s
army, and anticipating that of Castaños’s, he
consulted with his general officers, and informed
Sir John Moore of their unanimous opinion, that
he ought not to advance till his whole force was
assembled there, which would not be before the
4th of December. Sir John Moore’s opinion of
the hopelessness of affairs was thus confirmed by
Sir David Baird. “I see my situation,” he said
in his journal, “as clearly as any one, that nothing
can be worse; yet I am determined to
form the junction of the army, and to try our
fortune. We have no business here as things are;
but, being here, it would never do to abandon
the Spaniards without a struggle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John Moore resolves to retreat upon Portugal, and embark from Lisbon.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>It was not long before intelligence arrived
that Castaños was defeated, and his army dispersed.

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Nov. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

This event the British Commander had
expected; it had always been his opinion that
the south of Spain ought to have been the scene
of action; that Cadiz, not Coruña, should have
been chosen for the disembarkation of the English
army, and Seville or Cordoba the place of
their junction. He now determined to retreat
upon Portugal.... “Thus,” he said, in a letter to
the English ambassador, Mr. Frere, “he should
fall back upon his resources, cover a country
where there was a British interest, act as a diversion
in favour of Spain, if the French detached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
a force against him, and be ready to return to
the assistance of the Spaniards, should circumstances
again render it eligible. That such circumstances
would occur he had no expectation.
The French, he thought, would have little more
to do to subdue the country than to march over
it, though, after the conquest, they might have
troublesome subjects.” And, in his letter to Sir
David Baird, ordering him to fall back upon
Coruña, and sail from thence for the Tagus, he
directed him to write immediately to England,
and order that transports might be sent to Lisbon;
“they will be wanted,” said he; “for when
the French have Spain, Portugal cannot be defended.”
He had written a few days before this
to Lord Castlereagh, saying, that he had ordered
a depôt of provisions, for a short consumption,
to be formed at Almeida, and perhaps the same
should be done at Elvas; in that case, the progress
of the enemy might be checked, while the
stores were embarking at Lisbon, and arrangements
made for taking off the army. Beyond
this, the defence of Lisbon or of Portugal should
not be thought of. In communicating his resolution
of retiring to the British government,
he wrote in the same spirit of utter despondency.
“If the French,” said he, “succeed in Spain, it
will be vain to attempt to resist them in Portugal.
Portugal could not be defended against a superior
enemy; the Spaniards, however, might
rally in the south, and the English might still
be of use, if they were landed at Cadiz. But it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
was impossible to be very sanguine on this subject,
after what had been seen.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>He asks the opinion of the British Ambassador.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When this intention of retreating was made
known to the army at Salamanca, murmurs against
it were heard in every quarter, and from men of
all ranks. Even the staff officers lamented the
resolution of their Commander. In his letter to
Mr. Frere, written before the defeat of Castaños
was known, Sir John Moore had proposed as
a question, what the British army should do, in
case of that event; whether he should retreat
upon Portugal, or march upon Madrid, and throw
himself into the heart of Spain, thus to run all
risks, and share the fortunes of the Spanish nation?
“This movement,” he said, “would be
one of great hazard, as his retreat to Cadiz or
Gibraltar must be very uncertain, and he should
be entirely in the power of the Spaniards; but
perhaps it was worthy of risk, if the government
and people of Spain were thought to have still
sufficient energy, and the means to recover from
their defeats.” “The question,” said Sir John
Moore to Mr. Frere, “is not purely a military
one. It belongs at least as much to you as to
me to decide upon it. Your communications
with the Spanish government, and the opportunities
you have had of judging of the general
state of the country, enable you to form as just
an estimate of the resistance that is likely to be
offered. You are perhaps better acquainted with
the views of the British cabinet; and the question
is, what would that cabinet direct, were they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_474">474</span>
upon the spot to determine? It is of much importance
that this should be thoroughly considered;
it is comparatively of very little, on whom
shall rest the greatest share of responsibility. I
am willing to take the whole, or a part; but I
am very anxious to know your opinion.” Mr.
Frere knew that what the Spanish government
most deprecated was, a retreat of the English
upon Lisbon. It would sink the hearts of the
whole country, and would make them believe
that England, after an ineffectual effort, had relapsed
into the old limited system of protecting
Portugal. If, therefore, a retreat were determined
upon, as absolutely necessary, he thought
the army should fall back upon Galicia, and the
strong country about Astorga. But he said, in
his reply to the General, that Leon and the two
Castilles (with the exception of La Mancha and
the city of Madrid) were the provinces least distinguished
for a military, patriotic, or provincial
spirit in all Spain: the people had been passive
during the late events, and had seen their country
successively occupied by the strongest party. It
was difficult to blame them: living in open villages,
in vast plains, without arms and without
horses, they had neither the means of defence
or escape. That country must necessarily belong
to the party which was superior in cavalry; ...
yet even there there was no want of a right
feeling; the towns were abandoned at the approach
of the enemy; not a single magistrate
had been brought over to take the oath of allegiance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
to the Intruder, nor had the French
been able to enlist a single soldier. The other
provinces were possessed by the most ardent and
determined spirit. There was no doubt of the
people. The government was new, and had hitherto
been too numerous to be very active; but
there was hope that that inconvenience would
soon be remedied. “They are resolute,” said
Mr. Frere, “and I believe every man of them
determined to perish with the country. They
will not at least set the example, which the ruling
powers and higher orders of other countries have
exhibited, of weakness and timidity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Mr. Frere wishes him to advance for the defence of Madrid.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Great advantages, the ambassador thought,
would result from advancing speedily to cover
Madrid. It was a point of great moment for
effect in Spain, and still more in France, and in
the west of Europe. The people of the town
were full of resolution, and determined to defend
it, in spite of its situation; and nothing could
be more unfavourable to the claim of the Intruder
than a siege of the capital. The first object of
the English, therefore, he thought, should be to
march there, and collect a force capable of resisting
the French, before farther reinforcements
arrived from France. There were reports that
the resistance to the conscription had been much
more obstinate than usual, and a pastoral letter
of the Bishop of Carcassone seemed to prove that
these reports were not wholly without foundation.
An advantage obtained over the French
now would be doubly valuable, inasmuch as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_476">476</span>
would render a conscription, for a third attempt
upon Spain, infinitely difficult, if not impracticable.
But if, with their present forces, they
were allowed to retain their present advantages,
and to wait the completion of the conscription,
they would pour in forces, which would give
them immediate possession of the capital and
central provinces, and the war would then be
reduced to an absolute competition between the
two countries, which could stand out longest
against the waste of population.</p>

<p>If, however, Mr. Frere said, this view of the
subject should not appear sufficiently clear or
conclusive to the Commander-in-chief, to induce
him to take this step, which he, the Ambassador,
was well convinced would meet with the approbation
of his Majesty’s government, he would
venture to recommend retaining the position of
Astorga. A retreat from thence to Coruña (as
far, said he, as an unmilitary man may be allowed
to judge of a country which he has travelled over)
would be less difficult than through Portugal to
Lisbon; and we ought in that position to wait
for the reinforcements of cavalry from England:
the army would thus be enabled to act in the
flat country, which opens immediately from that
point, and extends through the whole of Leon
and Old Castille.... Before this letter arrived, the
General’s resolution had been taken, in consequence
of the news of Castaños’s defeat. It was
not shaken by the reasoning of the Ambassador,
whose opinion he had asked, and he waited only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
for the junction of General Hope, to commence
his retreat on Portugal.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1808.<br />December.</span>
<br /><hr />
Two Spanish Generals sent to confer with Sir John Moore.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Junta had wished it had been possible
for Sir John Moore to have conferred personally
with them at Aranjuez, or with the military
council at Madrid, and he himself had formed
the same wish, believing that unless prompt and
efficacious measures were taken, the defeat of
the Spanish armies and the ruin of their cause
were inevitable. But as this could not be, the
Captain-General of Granada, with another officer,
selected for his reputation and military experience,
were deputed to consult with him at Salamanca.
These Generals, in representing the
resources of the Spaniards, enumerated the force
under San Juan, and relied upon the pass of Somosierra;
but Colonel Graham had just arrived
before them with news that the pass had been
won; and Sir John considered them personally
as weak old men, and officially as having no information
upon which any plan could be concerted.
Mistaking, as he did, the spirit of the
nation, and undervaluing its strength, he gave no
ear to their urgent desire that he would form a
junction with Romana, and thereby draw off the
enemy from Madrid, nor to their declaration that
his retreat, if he persisted in that intention, would
immediately occasion the destruction of Spain.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Morla and the Military Junta urge him to advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the 5th of December, a dispatch arrived
from Castelfranco and Morla, informing him that
about 25,000 men, of the central army, were
falling back on Madrid; that 10,000 from Somosierra<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
were coming thither; and that nearly
40,000 would join them. With that number of
troops, the French army, which had presented
itself, was not to be feared. But the Junta, apprehending
an increase of the hostile forces,
hoped he would be able to unite with their army,
or fall on the rear of the enemy; and they did
not doubt that the rapidity of his movements
would be such as the interests of both countries
required. This letter was written on the second,
and the men who signed it had then determined
to betray their country, ... but though they might
have wished and designed to draw on the British
army to its destruction, the proposal that it
should advance came not from them alone, but
from the civil and military Junta also, and was
such as true Spaniards would have given. While
Sir John was considering this letter, Colonel
Charmilly, a French emigrant in the British service,
and denizened in England, arrived, with
dispatches from Mr. Frere. Colonel Charmilly
was in Madrid on the night of the first, when the
inhabitants were working by torch-light at the
trenches, breaking up the streets, and barricading
the houses. He had seen the Duque del Infantado,
who told him there were provisions and ammunition
in Madrid; that more than 30,000 men
had that day enlisted themselves as volunteers;
and that it was of material importance to the
common cause that the British commander
should make a diversion, which would compel
the French to divide their forces, and thus afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
some relief to Madrid. This he requested Charmilly
to communicate to Sir John Moore, as he
himself had been an eye-witness of the spirit of
the people, and the preparations which they were
making for resistance. By another Grandee he
was requested to say to Sir John Moore, that he
must make use of this moment to save Spain, by
making conditions with the Junta for a better
government; but especially that he should require
the Spanish army to be put under the
orders of the British Commander-in-chief for the
time being, as it had been under Lord Peterborough.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Col. Charmilly sent to Sir John Moore by the Duque del Infantado and Mr. Frere.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>When Charmilly reached Talavera, on his way,
he found that Mr. Frere had just arrived there,
following the Central Junta, who were retiring
from Aranjuez to Badajoz. To him he communicated
what had passed with the Duque del Infantado;
and the Ambassador requested him, as
a colonel in the British service, to take charge
of a letter to Sir John Moore, urging him to
suspend his retreat, as a measure which would
have the worst effect upon the Spanish cause,
and be of the greatest injury both to Spain and
England. But thinking that, having begun the
retreat, Sir John might suppose himself engaged
to go on with it, Mr. Frere entrusted Colonel
Charmilly with a second letter, to be delivered in
case the General persisted in his determination.
The purport of this letter was to request that the
bearer might be examined before a council of
war; and the reason for this measure was, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_480">480</span>
the decision of a council of war would exonerate
the Commander-in-chief from the responsibility
by which he might otherwise feel himself fettered.
Charmilly reached Salamanca while Sir John was
deliberating upon the dispatch from Morla and
Castelfranco. He delivered the Ambassador’s
first letter. The state of Madrid, Mr. Frere
said, so much exceeded every thing which he
had ventured to say of the spirit and resolution
of the people, that he could not forbear representing
to the General, in the strongest manner,
the propriety, not to say the necessity, of supporting
the Spanish people by all the means
which had been entrusted to him for that purpose.
“I have no hesitation,” he added, “in taking
upon myself any degree of responsibility which
may attach itself to this advice, as I consider
the fate of Spain as depending absolutely, for the
present, upon the decision which you may adopt.
I say, for the present; for such is the spirit and
character of the country, that, even if abandoned
by the British, I should by no means despair of
their ultimate success.” Having read this letter,
and heard Charmilly’s communication, Sir John
Moore gave him no reason to suppose that the
intention of retreating would be given up. He
retired, however, to reflect upon what he had heard.
His instructions directed him to receive the representations
both of the Spanish government
and the British Ambassador with the utmost deference
and attention: ... both deprecated his
retreat. Charmilly had been an eye-witness of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>
the preparations which were making in Madrid,
and accounts confirming his report came from
various quarters. He was persuaded that a great
improvement in the public affairs had taken
place, and that it was not becoming him to fly
at such a time; and he wrote, that night, to Sir
David Baird, telling him to suspend his retrograde
march till he heard again, and to make arrangements
for returning to Astorga, should it be necessary.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John Moore resolves to advance.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Still the rooted feeling of his heart was despondency.
In this very letter he expressed his
fear that the spirit of resistance had arisen too
late, and that the French were now too strong to
be resisted in that manner. All this, he said,
appeared to him very strange and unsteady; yet
if the spirit of enthusiasm did arise, and the
people would be martyrs, there was no saying,
in that case, what a British force might do. In
the morning he wrote a second letter, ordering
Sir David to return to Astorga. “We must be
at hand,” said he, “to aid and take advantage of
whatever happens. The wishes of our country
and our duty demand this of us, with whatever
risk it may be attended.” But he added, “I
mean to proceed bridle in hand; for if the
bubble bursts, and Madrid falls, we shall have a
run for it.” These were ominous words. It was
apparent that he had no confidence in the patriotism
of the Spaniards, nor in his own means
of resisting the French, however strong the
country; it was apparent also, that, while these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
impressions weighed upon him, he looked on
with apprehension to the opinion of the English
public, and that in deference to that opinion he
was sacrificing his own.</p>

<p>While Sir John was dispatching these instructions,
it was not known at Salamanca that he had
changed his intention of retreating: officers and
men alike were delivering their opinions loudly,
and speaking of another investigation. Charmilly
hearing this, and being equally ignorant of the
determination which had been formed, supposed
that his second letter was necessary, and accordingly
delivered it. The General, not perceiving
the intent for which it was written, and
feeling like a high-spirited officer who thought
himself injured, tore the letter in pieces, and
gave vent to his indignation in violent language.
Part of his anger fell upon Charmilly, and, on
the following day, he ordered him to quit Salamanca.
Charmilly respectfully represented that
he had not deserved such treatment. The General
replied that he did not mean to give him
the smallest offence; but he repeated the order,
and it was obeyed. Sir John Moore, in his resentment
for what he conceived the improper
interference of the Ambassador, soon, however,
recollected what was due to him as the King’s minister.
He told Mr. Frere, therefore, that he
should abstain from any remarks on the two
letters delivered by Colonel Charmilly, or on the
message which accompanied them. “I certainly,”
said he, “did feel and express much indignation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_483">483</span>
at a person like him being made the
channel of a communication of that sort from you
to me. Those feelings are at an end, and I dare
say they never will be excited towards you again.
If M. Charmilly is your friend, it was, perhaps,
natural for you to employ him; but I have prejudices
against all that class, and it is impossible
for me to put any trust in him.” He informed
the Minister that every thing should be done,
for the assistance of Madrid and the Spanish
cause, that could be expected from such an army
as he commanded, ... but he could not make a
direct movement on Madrid, because the passes
of Guadarrama and Somosierra were in the hands
of the French, and, besides, he was much too
weak, until joined by Sir David Baird.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>News of the surrender of Madrid.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Dec. 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following day, Sir John received a
letter from the Junta of Toledo, telling him
they intended to re-unite the dispersed armies
there, and defend the city to the last. He
replied, that if the Spaniards acted up to such
sentiments, there could be no doubt of their ultimate
success, whatever temporary advantages
the French might gain; and he sent a British
officer to reside at Toledo, and concert measures
for its defence. On the 8th, he informed Sir
David Baird that he should move a corps on the
10th to Zamora and Toro, and ordered him to
push on his troops, by brigades, to Benevente.
But, on the 9th, Colonel Graham, whom he had
dispatched to Morla and Castelfranco, returned
from Talavera, with tidings that these men had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
surrendered Madrid. The number of the French
there was computed at between 20,000 and
30,000 men, and it was said that they remained
at the Retiro, not having taken possession of the
city, in consequence of the temper of the inhabitants.
Another part of the French army
was engaged in besieging Zaragoza. From Toledo
the news was equally discouraging: Victor
no sooner approached than it was surrendered to
him. These circumstances did not induce the
British General to alter his plan: his object was
to threaten the French communications, draw
their attention from Madrid and Zaragoza, and
thus favour any movements which might be projected
by the armies forming on the south of the
Tagus. If no advantage was taken of it, and no
efforts made, he saw that the French might turn
against him what portion of their force they
pleased. That they would be able to do this he
expected; and he believed that nothing which
his army could effect would be attended with
any other advantage than the character which
might be won for the British arms. He looked,
therefore, to a retreat, as an event which would
soon be unavoidable; in his dispatches home,
dissuaded the government from sending out reinforcements,
and desired that transports might
be ready, at Lisbon, and at Vigo, to receive the
troops; being fully persuaded that the efforts of
England could be of no avail, and that it would
be necessary to evacuate the peninsula.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Correspondence with Romana.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Having determined, in this inauspicious state<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
of mind, upon advancing, he wrote to Romana,
who was then at Leon, collecting and refitting
the remains of Blake’s army. Sir John complained
to him that he had been put in no communication
with any of the Spanish armies, had
been kept perfectly in the dark with respect to
their movements, the plans of their generals and
their government, and that while his army was
on the march to assemble and unite itself, he had
been left exposed, without the least support.
Therefore, though his wish had always been to
co-operate with the Spaniards, it became necessary
for him, finding that he was left to himself,
to think of himself alone. Under that feeling he
had ordered the corps at Astorga to fall back on
Coruña, and meant himself to retire upon Portugal,
there to be ready for the assistance of
Spain whenever their affairs were better managed,
and an opportunity offered for doing them any
good. Perhaps this opportunity had now occurred;
and as his retreat had been reluctant, so
he had stopped it the moment a chance of acting
to advantage presented itself. His wish now
was to unite with the Marques, for whose character
he had the highest respect, and who would
always find him ready to undertake whatever
was practicable for the service of the Spanish
nation. The account which Romana gave of his
army in reply was far from encouraging. He had
20,000 men under arms, but they were almost all
without haversacks, cartridge boxes, and shoes,
and at least two-thirds were without clothing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
from head to foot. Their spirits however were
good, and if they were well fed they would do
their duty. Their dispersion in Biscay had been
wholly owing to the want of subsistence. He
should not doubt of uniting with Sir John, and
concerting a decisive attack upon the troops
which surrounded Madrid, were it not for a division
of 8000 or 10,000 men, extending from
Sahagun to Almanza, whose apparent object was
to check his army. As long as they remained
in that position, he could not abandon his, because
it would leave them a free way into Asturias;
they would take possession of the country
from whence he drew large supplies, and
they would threaten the passage into Galicia.
A combined movement with Sir David Baird
might oblige them to fall back upon Reynosa,
and then it would not be difficult to form a
junction.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>First skirmish at Rueda.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From the beginning Sir John Moore had
thought so poorly of the Spaniards, that this account
of the force with which he was to co-operate
could make no alteration in his views.
It was perfectly understood by him that he must
stand, or fall, by his own means. He left Salamanca
on the 12th. On the same day, Lord
Paget, with the principal part of the cavalry,
marched from Toro to Tordesillas; and General
Stuart surprised and cut off a party of French
who were posted at Rueda. This was the first
encounter between the British and French in
Spain; and the prisoners declared it was universally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>
believed that the English army had retreated.
On the 14th, when Sir John was at
Alaejos, a packet of letters, from the head-quarters
of the French army, was brought to him.
Some peasantry had killed the officer who had
them in charge. Among them was a letter from
Berthier to Marshal Soult, directing him to take
possession of Leon, drive the enemy into Galicia,
and make himself master of Benevente and Zamora.
He would have no English in front, it
was said; for every thing evinced that they were
in full retreat. A movement had been made to
Talavera, on the road to Badajoz, which must
compel them to hasten to Lisbon, if they were
not already gone; and when they had retired,
the Emperor thought Soult could do whatever
he pleased. It appeared from this letter, that
Soult had two divisions with him at Saldaña;
that Junot was collecting another at Burgos;
and that another, under Mortier (Duke of Treviso),
had been ordered to march against Zaragoza.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Head-quarters removed to Toro.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir John had intended to march to Valladolid,
but seeing that Soult was stronger than had been
represented, he thought it better to move to
Toro, and unite his army there, Sir David Baird
doing the same at Benevente, from whence the
two corps might be joined, either by a forward
or flank movement, and strike a blow against
Soult, before that General should be reinforced.
While the head-quarters were at Toro, a member
of the Junta arrived there with Mr. Stuart. After<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
the manner in which Colonel Charmilly had been
dismissed, Mr. Frere had little reason to hope
that any thing would induce Sir John Moore to
alter his determination of retiring from the
country in despair. The Spanish Government

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The command of the Spanish armies offered to Sir J. Moore.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

had, however, pressed him to make one effort
more: if that determination were persisted in,
they said, it would bring on the most dreadful
consequences. The measures which alone could
save Portugal and Spain would be completely
disconcerted, and England would have afforded
them succour only to make them rely on an
effective aid, and then to withdraw it at the
critical moment when it was most needed. In
reality, the enemy at this moment exposed himself
to ruin by dividing his army to cover such
an extended line. Romana would join Sir John
Moore with 14,000 men, and the Junta had taken
such measures that within a month 30,000 would
be raised in Leon, Galicia, and Asturias. Mr.
Frere inclosed this note to the British Commander,
and reminding him of the immense responsibility
with which he charged himself in
adopting a measure which must be followed by
immediate if not final ruin to our ally, and by
indelible disgrace to the country with whose
resources he was entrusted, expressed a hope
that Mr. Stuart, who was personally esteemed
by the General, would by that advantage be enabled
to urge this argument with the warmth of
regard. “I am unwilling,” he pursued, “to enlarge
upon a subject in which my feelings must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
be stifled, or expressed at the risk of offence;
which, with such an interest at stake, I should
feel unwilling to excite. But this much I must
say, that if the British army had been sent abroad
for the express purpose of doing the utmost
possible mischief to the Spanish cause, with the
single exception of not firing a shot against their
troops, they would, according to the measures
now announced as about to be pursued, have
completely fulfilled their purpose.... That the defence
of Galicia should be abandoned, must appear
incredible.”... This letter arrived too late to
have any influence upon Sir John’s movements;
he had advanced, but it was with a heavy heart:
and when the Deputy from the Junta, D. Francisco
Xavier Caro, at this time offered him the
command in chief of the Spanish armies, he refused
it. He would not have done this if he
had had any hope of acting with success against
the enemy, or any intention of making a stand
against them: for at this time he learnt that
Romana was beginning to retire on Galicia, and
felt how inconvenient it was that the army which
was to co-operate with him should be independent
of him. He therefore wrote to the Marques,
saying, he had looked for the assistance of such
part of his corps as was fit to move; and had
expected also that the road to Coruña would
have been left open for the British army, as that
by which it must receive its supplies, and the only
one by which it must retreat, if compelled so to
do. Romana replied, that he should have had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span>
no thought of retreating had it not been for the
intelligence which he received from Sir D. Baird;
that he was ready to act with Sir John; and that
this was the moment, not for retreating, but for
trying what could be done against the enemy,
and drawing him from the capital.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Junction with Sir D. Baird formed.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The junction with Sir D. Baird was formed at
Mayorga on the 20th; the united force amounting
to something more than 28,000 men, of whom
2450 were cavalry, with 50 pieces of artillery.
The cavalry under Lord Paget were pushed forward,
and having learned that some of the enemy’s
cavalry were posted at Sahagun, Lord Paget endeavoured
to cut them off. The alarm was given,
and they had time to form in a favourable position;
but they were out-manœuvred, charged,
overthrown in a moment, and dispersed in every
direction, with the loss of many killed, and 157
prisoners, including two Lieutenant-Colonels.
In this affair about 400 of the 15th Hussars encountered
nearly 700 French; and the British
felt and proved their own exceeding great superiority.
Head-quarters were advanced to Sahagun
on the 21st. The weather was severe;
the roads bad, and covered with snow; and as
the troops had suffered from forced marches,
they halted there for a day, and there a co-operation
with Romana was finally concerted,
the Marques engaging to move with from 9000<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
to 10,000 men, being that part of his force which
was sufficiently clothed and armed to take the
field. Pitiable as their condition appeared when
they were compared to troops so admirably
equipped as the English, it was, nevertheless,
evident, even to a desponding observer, that they
might be brought into action as auxiliaries, to
occupy part of the enemy’s force, and to complete
his destruction in case of victory.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>They advance against M. Soult.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>According to the information which Romana
could obtain, Soult’s corps consisted of about
9000 infantry and 1000 horse; but that General,
apprehending that some attempt would be made
against him, had applied for reinforcements, and
without waiting for them, called to his assistance
the nearest troops; he had thus brought together
about 18,000 men, who were posted behind the
river Carrion. Every arrangement was made for
attacking him, and orders were issued accordingly,
... never more welcome to a British army.
The convents in Sahagun were prepared for the
reception of the wounded; and the soldiers confidently
anticipated a glorious victory. Their
general was less sanguine. “The movement I
am making,” he said to Mr. Frere, “is of the
most dangerous kind. I not only risk to be
surrounded every moment by superior forces,
but to have my communication with Galicia intercepted.
I wish it to be apparent to the whole
world, as it is to every individual of the army,
that we have done every thing in our power in
support of the Spanish cause, and that we do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
abandon it until long after the Spaniards had
abandoned us.” The truth is, that nothing had
been done; but he was disgusted with the Spanish
Government, and he had no faith in the
people: his own judgement would have led him
to fall back from Salamanca; and he only advanced
because he knew what would be the feelings
of the English nation, if its army had retired
without attempting any thing. Offended with
Mr. Frere, for having given his opinion, when
he himself had asked it, he did not deem the
suggestion of that Minister, as to making a stand
at Astorga, worthy of consideration. It was at
once rejected, as futile; and he advanced against
this detachment of the French, “bridle in hand,”
as he himself said, and expecting to “have a run
for it,” ... not thinking that any possible benefit
could result from a victory, but seeking a reason
which might appear valid to the people of England
for abandoning the peninsula, and for leaving
Spain and Portugal to their fate.... “It was necessary
to risk this army,” he said, “to convince
the people of England, as well as the rest of
Europe, that the Spaniards had neither the power
nor the inclination to make any efforts for themselves.
With respect to the cause, it will probably
have no effect. Even if I beat Marshal
Soult, it will be attended with no other effect
than the character it will attach to the British
arms.”</p>

<p>At the hour appointed, the whole force was
under arms; the right column had begun its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
march, and the rest were in high spirits, expecting
the word of command: ... just at this time
came a letter from Romana, with intelligence

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The French endeavour to surround the British army.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that the French were advancing from Madrid,
either to Valladolid or Salamanca; and information
to the same purport was received by other
messengers, and also, that considerable reinforcements

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 23.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

had arrived at Carrion from Palencia.
Orders were immediately issued that the troops
should go back to their quarters, and by daybreak
next morning be again under arms. “In
my life,” says one who was present, “I never witnessed
such an instantaneously-withering effect
upon any body of living creatures! A few murmurs
only were heard, but every countenance
was changed, and they who, the minute before,
were full of that confidence which ensures victory,
were at once deprived of all heart and

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir J. Moore begins his retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

hope.” The next morning General Hope fell
back to Mayorga, on the road to Benevente,
with his own division and with General Fraser’s.
Sir David Baird was ordered to pass the river
Ezla at Valencia de San Juan: on Christmas-day
the Commander-in-chief followed General Hope,
with the reserve and the light brigades; and the
cavalry, under Lord Paget, followed the reserve
on the 26th. When Sir John Moore apprized
Romana that he should fall back, he told him
that if he were pursued he should stop and offer
battle: and in a second communication from
Sahagun he said, that if he were pressed after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
crossing the Ezla, he should have no objection
to try an action. But he had made up his mind
to lose some of his baggage, and not to fight, if
he could avoid it. Astorga was to be his rallying
point: there he informed Romana he should
stand, as his retreat from thence, if necessary,
would be secure, and he should be in the way
to receive the supplies and the reinforcements
which he expected from England. At the worst,
he could defend himself, and, with Romana’s aid,
defend Galicia. “You may rest assured,” he
added, “that I shall not retreat a foot beyond
what is necessary to secure my supplies from
being intercepted.... You will find no inclination
in me to abandon the Spanish cause.” But his
dispatches from Benevente, on the 28th, show
that this intention, if it had ever been seriously
entertained, was soon abandoned; and as for the
reinforcements, he had already countermanded
them in his feeling of despair. His force, he
said, when he reached Astorga, would be about
27,000; Romana could not have above 8000.
The troops moving against him he estimated at
not less than 50,000; and it was said that Buonaparte
himself was coming, with 10,000 of his
guards. His real purpose was not to stop longer
at Astorga than to secure the stores, and then
retreat to Villa Franca, where he had been told
there was a position. Romana had intimated to
him, some time ago, his intention of retiring into
Galicia by this route, but Sir John begged it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
might be left open to the English, being the
only communication they had for their retreat or
supplies.</p>

<p>From the 22d to the 24th, Soult received such
reinforcements as made his army superior to the
British. Junot, with the army which had been
transported from Portugal to France, had advanced
to Palencia, and threatened their right
flank. Buonaparte was hastening from Madrid,
with his imperial cavalry, and all the disposable
force in that quarter. The force under Lefebvre
was counter-ordered from the road to Badajoz,
and directed toward Salamanca. The retreat of
the British upon Portugal was thus cut off. Of
the numbers advancing against him Sir John
Moore was not informed; and so little idea was
there of flying when he began his retreat, that it
was determined to carry off the prisoners; and
they were accordingly stowed in covered waggons.
A thaw came on the day when they first
fell back; on the following it rained without intermission:
the soil in that part of the country
is a heavy loam, and the roads were above a foot
deep in clay. The proclamations of the French
travelled faster than the British army: these were,
as usual, full of promises which would not be fulfilled,
and menaces which would. They were
come, they said, to deliver Spain; to emancipate
the people from the yoke of a tyrannical nobility
and a fanatic priesthood. All persons who remained
quiet in their houses, or who, having forsaken
them, speedily returned, should receive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
no injury; but otherwise, whatsoever belonged
to them should be confiscated. Unhappily, the
conduct of our people now began to give effect
to these hand-bills. The soldiers were indignant

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Ill conduct of the troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

with the Spaniards for their apparent supineness;
they were exasperated by the conduct of
some poor wretches, whose carts had been pressed
to carry the sick and wounded, and who, as many
of them as could, had taken their mules, and run
away in the night, because the movements of a
retreating army exposed themselves to imminent
danger, and their beasts to certain destruction.
Weary and disheartened, in want of rest and
food, disappointed in their confident hopes of
victory, and indignant at turning their backs
upon an enemy whom they would so eagerly
have met in the field, it was a relief for them to
vent these feelings, in the shape of anger, upon
the only objects within their reach. In this
temper they began to plunder and commit havoc
wherever they went; and the officers, many of
whom already murmured at the rapidity of the
retreat, and were discontented with the total
silence which the Commander-in-chief maintained
respecting his future measures, did not
exert themselves as they ought to have done, to
prevent these excesses.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Passage of the Ezla.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Dec. 26.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir David Baird, who took the shorter line
to Astorga, by way of Valencia de S. Juan,
effected his march without molestation. The
sick and wounded, following the same track,
halted at the latter place, to pass the night.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_497">497</span>
Hardly had they been provided with the necessary
food, and laid to rest, before the alarm
was sounded, and they were again hurried into
the waggons. The night was cold, misty, and
exceeding dark, and the Ezla was to be crossed
some little distance from the town. They were
not provided with pontoons. The ford is dangerous,
because of the rapidity of the stream,
occasioned by two narrow banks of shingles,
which form an angle in the middle; and at this
time the river was fast rising, from the melting
of the snow upon the mountains. A serjeant’s
guard had been left by Sir David on the opposite
bank, to assist the waggons in passing, and skuttle
two ferry-boats, when they had effected their passage.
They kindled a fire with grass and rushes,
for the sake of its light, but the materials were
wet, and the wind soon extinguished it. A Spanish
muleteer attempted to guide them over the
ford: his mule tripped in the mid stream, he was
thrown, and saved by a soldier, when just in the
act of sinking. Perilous, however, as the ford
was, the passage was accomplished, without other
loss than that of some baggage-waggons, which
broke down.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>General orders issued at Benevente.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Sir John Moore, meantime, with the other
division of the army, reached Benevente, and
there found it necessary to issue general orders,

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 27.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which reflected severely upon the conduct both
of his men and officers. “The misbehaviour of
the column which had marched by Valderas exceeded,”
he said, “what he could have believed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_498">498</span>
of British soldiers. He could feel no mercy
towards officers who neglected, in times like
these, essential duties, nor towards soldiers who
disgraced their country, by acts of villany towards
the people whom they were sent to protect.”
Alluding then to the discontent which was
manifested at the hurry of the retreat, and the
mystery which was thrown over their proceedings,
he said, “it was impossible for the General
to explain to his army the motives of the movements
which he directed; he could, however,
assure them, that he had made none since he
left Salamanca which he did not foresee, and
was not prepared for; and, as far as he was a
judge, they had answered the purposes for which
they were intended. When it was proper to fight
a battle he would do it, and he would choose the
time and place which he thought most fit. In
the meantime, he begged the officers and men
to attend diligently to discharge <em>their</em> parts, and
leave to <em>him</em>, with the general officers, the decision
of measures which belonged to them alone.”
Strong as this language was, it had no effect,
and the havoc which had been committed at
Valderas was renewed at Benevente. The castle
there is one of the finest monuments of the age
of chivalry; we have nothing in England which
approaches to its grandeur: Berkley, Raby, even
Warwick and Windsor are poor fabrics in comparison.
With Gothic grandeur, it has the richness
of Moorish decoration; open galleries, where
Saracenic arches are supported by pillars of porphyry<span class="pagenum" id="Page_499">499</span>
and granite; cloisters, with fountains playing
in their courts; jasper columns and tesselated
floors, niches, alcoves, and seats in the walls, over-arched
in various forms, and enriched with every
grotesque adornment of gold and silver, and
colours which are hardly less gorgeous. It belonged
to the Duke of Ossuna; and the splendour
of old times was still continued there. The extent
of this magnificent structure may be estimated
from this circumstance, that two regiments, besides
artillery, were quartered within its walls.
They proved the most destructive enemies that
had ever entered them: their indignant feelings
broke out again in acts of wanton mischief; and
the officers, who felt and admired the beauties of
this venerable pile, attempted in vain to save it
from devastation. Every thing combustible was
seized, fires were lighted against the fine walls,
and pictures of unknown value, the works, perhaps,
of the greatest Spanish masters, and of
those other great painters who left so many of
their finest productions in Spain, were heaped
together as fuel. The archives of the family fortunately
escaped.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Affair of cavalry on the Ezla.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The soldiers had, however, here an opportunity
of displaying a spirit more becoming them as

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 28.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

Englishmen. Soon after the rear of the army
had marched into the town, an alarm was given
that the enemy were on the opposite heights.
In an instant all was on the alert; every man
hastened to his place of rendezvous; the cavalry
poured out of the gates: ... the plain in the opposite
direction was covered with fugitives, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_500">500</span>
the streets were filled with women bewailing
their fate, and calling upon the Saints and the
Virgin for protection. The French, seeing with
what alacrity they would be encountered, looked
at our men from the heights, and retired. It was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 29.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

towards evening, and as the enemy were so near,
orders were given to destroy the bridge. This
was effected about daybreak the following morning;
and it was supposed that their progress was
for a while impeded. The troops again continued
their retreat, and the whole of the infantry and
heavy artillery had departed, when intelligence
arrived that the French were again appearing,
and that their cavalry were in the act of passing
the Ezla: ... they had found a ford about three
hundred yards below the bridge. Lord Paget
and General Stewart were still in the town. The
picquets of the night, under Lieutenant-Colonel
Otway and Major Bagwell, were sent down; the
cavalry were ordered to repair to their alarm posts;
and many volunteers came forward. Lord Paget
hastened to the spot: he found four squadrons
of imperial guards already formed and skirmishing
with the picquets; other cavalry were in the
act of passing. The 10th Hussars were sent for:
as soon as they arrived, General Stewart placed
himself at the head of the picquets, and charged
the enemy. The French gave way, and repassed
the ford more expeditiously than they had crossed
it. They formed again on the other side, and
threatened a second attempt; but three pieces<span class="pagenum" id="Page_501">501</span>
of horse artillery, which now came up, were stationed
near the bridge, and opened a fire upon
them, that did considerable execution. About
seventy prisoners were taken; among them General
Lefebvre Desnouettes, Commander of the
imperial guard of cavalry. The loss of the enemy
could not be ascertained: it was variously guessed,
from 60 to 200. Ours was about 50 in killed and
wounded. It was reported that Buonaparte was
on the heights during this action.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John Moore reaches Astorga.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The ardour of the French was manifestly
damped by this fresh proof of British valour;
and they continued their pursuit at such respectful
distance, that the rear of the army, which
had been engaged with them, reached Bañeza

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Dec. 30.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

that night unmolested. The next day the Commander-in-chief
reached Astorga. This was the
rallying point, and here they found about 5000
men of Romana’s army. That army was literally
half naked and half starved; a malignant typhus
fever was raging among them, and sixty or
seventy were sent daily to the hospitals. About
this number, however, were fit for service. Romana
arrived there the same day. The first intimation
that the French were advancing to interpose
between Portugal and the British army
had been received from him; but it was his
opinion that that information ought to have produced
no change in Sir John Moore’s intentions.
The intended attack, he thought, ought still to
have been made; Soult might have been beaten
in time to fall upon the corps which was coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_502">502</span>
to reinforce him, and by the success which prompt
and vigorous measures would have ensured, they
should have become masters of Leon and Castille.
To his utter astonishment he now found that there
was no intention of making a stand at Astorga,
part of the British army being already on the way
to Villa Franca, and a regiment of cavalry all that
was left on the side of Bañeza. He went therefore
to the British Commander, and represented
to him the propriety of facing the enemy where
they were, a point from whence they had always
a secure retreat by the passes of Manzanal and
Foncebadon, ... passes so strong that a small force
might maintain them against any numbers. He
represented to him also, that the park of artillery
was at Ponferrada, where also the hospitals were
established, and there were magazines of corn;
that in Villa Franca there were more than 2000
sick, with hospital stores and depôts of arms,
and therefore it was of the utmost consequence
to defend the Bierzo. But Sir John Moore replied,
that he had determined upon retiring into
Galicia, because his troops required rest. He
desired that the high road of Manzanal might be
left to him, saying, he would defend that and the
principal entrance to Galicia by Villa Franca; and
that Romana might take the Foncebadon pass,
and enter by way of the Val de Orras and Puebla

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>Honourable conduct of Romana and his army.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

de Sanabria. And here a proof of Spanish magnanimity
was given by these half armed, half
naked, and half famished men, for such they
literally were. A malignant fever was raging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_503">503</span>
among them, and long fatigue, privations, and
disease, made them appear more like an ambulatory
hospital than an army. Under such
circumstances it might have been supposed they
would have sought to secure their retreat under
protection of the British to Coruña and Ferrol.
But Romana and his forlorn band were too high-minded
to attach themselves as a burden upon
those allies with whom they had so lately expected
to co-operate in honourable and hopeful
enterprise; and they assented without hesitation
to the British General’s desire. Romana only
requested that the British troops might no longer
be permitted to commit disorders which even in
an enemy’s country ought never to be allowed;
it must have been painful indeed for Sir John
Moore to have heard of such excesses, and still
more painful to feel, that in a retreat so hasty as
this was intended to be, it was impossible to prevent
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John Moore pursues his retreat.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The troops had been assured, at Benevente,
that they were not falling back upon Coruña,
but that their march was only to secure a more
favourable position: ... no affirmations could make
the soldiery believe this: and when Sir John
Moore reached Astorga, and issued his orders, it
was too manifest that they were not retreating,
but flying, before the enemy. Ammunition waggons
were burnt here, and an entire depôt of
entrenching tools abandoned, so that the army
was thus deprived of a most important means of
impeding the enemy’s progress. The position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_504">504</span>
at Villa Franca, which the Commander-in-chief
had formerly mentioned in his dispatches, was
no longer thought of. Two brigades under
General Craufurd, were detached, by way of
Orense, to Vigo, to which port Sir John had
ordered empty transports to be sent for him,
supposing it to be the best point of embarkation.
This detachment preceded Romana in the line
which he expected was to have been left for
him; and when he and his forlorn band, after
halting only one night, took their way toward
Orense, they found the country stripped of the
means of subsistence upon which they had
reckoned. General Fraser and his division were
immediately sent forward, with orders to proceed
to Lugo; he was followed by General Hope
and Sir David Baird, and their instructions were
to make forced marches to the coast. “With
respect to me and the British troops,” said the
Commander, in his official letter, “it has come
to that point which I have long foreseen....
From a desire to do what I could, I made the
movement against Soult: as a diversion, it has
answered completely; but as there is nothing to
take advantage of it, I have risked the loss of
the army for no purpose. I have no option now
but to fall down to the coast as fast as I am able....
We must all make forced marches, from the
scarcity of provisions, and to be before the enemy,
who, by roads upon our flanks, may otherwise intercept
us.”</p>

<p>It appears evident, from these expressions,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_505">505</span>
that Sir John Moore was not well informed of
the nature of the country through which he was
about to retreat. Westward of Astorga, two great

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span>The Bierzo.<span class="sne">♦</span></span>

ranges of mountains trend from north to south:
Puerto del Rabanal, Cruz de Ferro, and Foncebadon,
are those of the eastern branch; those of
the western are the Puerto del Cebrero, Puerto
del Courel, and Puerto del Aguiar; they meet,
on the south, with the Sierra de Sanabria, the
Sierra de Cabrera, and the Montes Aquilianos.
The tract which these mountains enclose is called
the Bierzo: from summit to summit it is about
sixteen leagues from north to south, and about
fourteen from east to west. The whole waters
of this amphitheatre have but one opening; they
are collected into the river Sil, and pass, through
a narrow gorge, into the Val de Orras, in Galicia....
The centre is a plain of about four square
leagues. There is scarcely in Europe a more
lovely tract of country, certainly no where a
more defensible one. The main road, one of
the finest in Europe, is that of Manzanal; that
of Foncebadon also leads into the Bierzo; there
is no third ingress, and from Villa Franca toward
Coruña the only way is that of the Puerto Cebrero;
both the former passes lead along defiles,
where, as Romana observed three months before
this miserable retreat, a thousand men might
stop the march of twenty times their number:
and beyond Villa Franca there is no lateral road.
Sir David Baird’s army had travelled this road;
they supposed that it could not possibly be intended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_506">506</span>
to fall back beyond that point. But the
Commander saw no security till he should reach
the coast; there he hoped to find transports ready,
or to take up some defensible position till they
arrived. The same difficulties which affected him
must affect his pursuers. It was not probable
that all the numbers which were now marching
against him would follow him the whole way;
and once on the coast, it was his determination
not to be molested by any thing like an equal
force: ... “it is only while retreating,” said he,
“that we are vulnerable.” His sole object now
was to bring off the army, ... to effect this he had
already destroyed great part of the ammunition
and military stores, and now left behind many
of the sick.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Disorders committed by the troops.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The mountain-tops were covered with heavy
clouds, and the roads knee-deep in snow. Provisions,
in a country where the natives are not
rich enough at any time to lay by a store, can
never be abundant, and what there were, had
already been exhausted by the repeated march
of troops, English and Spaniards. The little
order with which such food as could be found
was issued out, occasioned waste, and thereby
increased the evil. The men, half famished, half
frozen, and altogether desperate, were no longer
in any subordination. They forced their way
into the houses where their rations should have
been served, seized it by force, frequently spilling
the wine, and destroying more than they
could carry away. This was not all: ... pillage
could not be prevented. Houses and villages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_507">507</span>
were burning in all directions; but when they
thus acted as enemies, they were treated as such;
and many of them were put to death by the peasantry,
in revenge, or in self-defence.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Buonaparte stops at Astorga.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Buonaparte pursued in person no farther than
Astorga: he left Marshal Ney with 18,000 men
to keep that part of the country in subjection;
and assigned to Marshal Soult, with 23,000, what
he called the “glorious mission of destroying the
English army, ... pursuing them to their point of
embarkation, and driving them into the sea.”
Marshal Soult’s was an easy task: he had only
to follow the English just close enough to keep
them at the pace at which they set out, and not
come near enough to make them turn and stand
at bay; fatigue would do his work more surely
than the sword. From Astorga to Villa Franca
del Bierzo is fifteen leagues, about sixty English
miles; the road for the first four leagues is up
the mountain, but through an open country.
Having reached the summit of Foncebadon, you
enter into some of the strongest passes in Europe.
It would scarcely be possible for an invading
army to force their way here, against a
body of determined men. These passes continue
between two and three leagues, nearly to the
village of Torre; from thence, through Benvibre
and Ponferrada, nothing can be finer than the
country, and the circle of mountains which binds
it in. But never, in the most melancholy ages
of Spanish history, had a more miserable scene<span class="pagenum" id="Page_508">508</span>

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">1809.<br />January.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

been represented, than was now to be witnessed
here. The horses of the retreating army began
to fail, and this, in great measure, for want of
shoes and shoe-nails. There was no want of
iron to hammer new ones: there are iron-works
near Villa Franca, and enough might have been
procured, had there been time allowed. As soon
as these noble animals foundered, they were
shot, lest the enemy should profit by them. The
rain continued pouring, ... the baggage was to be
dragged, and the soldiers were to wade through
half-melted snows, ... the feet of the men as well
as of the beasts began to fail, ... more waggons
were left behind, ... more ammunition destroyed
along the way; and when the troops reached
Villa Franca, they were in such a state, that several
experienced officers predicted, if this march
against time were persevered in, a fourth of the
army would be left in the ditches, before it was

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 2.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

accomplished. More magazines and carriages
were here destroyed. Some of the men abandoning
themselves now, as knowing that if they
proceeded they must die of cold, hunger, and
weariness; they got into the wine cellars, and,
giving way to desperate excess, were found dead
when the French entered the town. When the
General marched with the reserve from Benvibre,
he left a detachment to cover the town,
while parties were sent to warn the stragglers of
their danger, and drive them out of the houses,
... for the place was filled with them, near a thousand
men of the preceding divisions having remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_509">509</span>
there, all abandoned to despair, and most
of them to drunkenness. A few were prevailed
upon to move on; the greater number were deaf
to threats, and insensible to danger, till the rear-guard
was compelled to march. A small detachment
of cavalry still covered them, and did not
quit the town till the enemy approached, and
then the road was filled with stragglers, armed
and unarmed, mules, carts, women, and children....
Four or five squadrons of French cavalry compelled
the detachment in the rear to retire, and
pursued them closely for several miles, till General
Paget, with the reserve, repulsed the pursuers.
As the French dragoons galloped through
the long line of these wretched stragglers, they
slashed them with their swords to the right and
left, ... the men being so insensible with liquor
that they neither attempted to resist nor get out
of the road. Some of these men having found
their way to the army, mangled as they were,
were paraded through the ranks, to show their
comrades the miserable consequence of drunkenness
at such a time.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Skirmish at Cacabelos.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The Spaniards at Villa Franca would not believe
that the French were advancing; through
so strong a country, and in so severe a season,
they thought it was impossible. Sir John Moore,
however, well knew that he was pursued, and he
was afraid of halting, lest the enemy should get
in his rear, and intercept him at Lugo; an apprehension
which could not have been entertained,
had he been acquainted with the country.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_510">510</span>
The troops, therefore, were hurried on: the artillery
and head-quarters went foremost; General
Baird’s column, and the cavalry, under Lord
Paget, covered the rear. The advanced guard
of the enemy, under General Colbert, were close
at their heels: Merle’s division joined them on

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 3.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the 3d, and on the afternoon of that day they
ventured to attack the rear-guard at Cacabelos.
They were repulsed by the dragoons and riflemen.
General Colbert received a ball in his
forehead, and fell; he was an officer of great promise,
and of so fine a person, that Canova is
said to have called him the modern Antinous.
Having thus once more shown the enemy what
they could do in battle, the rear of the army,
reluctantly and almost broken-hearted, continued
their retreat.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat continued from Villa Franca.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>From Villa Franca to Castro is one continued
ascent up Monte del Cebrero for about fifteen
miles, through one of the wildest, most delightful,
and most defensible countries in the world.
The road is a royal one, cut with great labour
and expense in the side of the mountain, and
following all its windings; ... for some part of
the way it overhangs the river Valcarce, a rapid
mountain stream, which falls into the Burbia
near the town, and afterwards joins the Sil, to
pass through the single outlet in the gorge of the
Bierzo. Oaks, alders, poplars, hazels, and chestnuts
grow in the bottom, and far up the side of
the hills: the apple, pear, cherry, and mulberry
are wild in this country; the wild olive, also, is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_511">511</span>
found here; and here are the first vineyards
which the traveller sees on his way from Coruña
into the heart of Spain. The mountains are cultivated
in some parts even to their summits, and
trenches are cut along their sides, for the purpose
of irrigating them. Even those writers whose
journals were written during the horrors of such
a flight noticed this scenery with admiration. It
was now covered with snow: ... there was neither
provision to sustain nature, nor shelter from the
rain and snow, nor fuel for fire, to keep the vital
heat from total extinction, nor place where the
weary and foot-sore could rest for a single hour
in safety. All that had hitherto been suffered
was but the prelude to this consummate scene of
horrors. It was still attempted to carry on some
of the sick and wounded: the beasts which drew
them failed at every step; and they were left in
their waggons, to perish amid the snow. “I
looked round,” says an officer, “when we had
hardly gained the highest point of those slippery
precipices, and saw the rear of the army winding
along the narrow road.... I saw their way marked
by the wretched people who lay on all sides expiring,
from fatigue and the severity of the cold:
... their bodies reddened in spots the white surface
of the ground.” The men were now desperate:
excessive fatigue, and the feeling of the
disgrace there was in thus flying before the enemy,
excited in them a spirit which was almost mutinous:
... a few hours’ pause was what they desired,
an opportunity of facing the French, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_512">512</span>
chance of an honourable and speedy death, the
certainty of sweetening their sufferings by taking
vengeance upon their pursuers. A Portugueze
bullock-driver, who had faithfully served the English
from the first day of their march, was seen
on his knees amid the snow, with his hands
clasped, dying in the attitude and act of prayer.
He had at least the comfort of religion in his
passing hour. The soldiers who threw themselves
down to perish by the way-side gave
utterance to far different feelings with their
dying breath: shame and strong anger were
their last sentiments; and their groans were
mingled with imprecations upon the Spaniards,
by whom they fancied themselves betrayed, and
upon the generals, who chose rather to let them
die like beasts than take their chance in the field
of battle. That no horror might be wanting,
women and children accompanied this wretched
army: ... some were frozen to death in the baggage-waggons,
which were broken down, or left
upon the road for want of cattle; some died of
fatigue and cold, while their infants were pulling
at the exhausted breast: ... one woman was taken
in labour upon the mountain; she lay down at
the turning of an angle rather more sheltered than
the rest of the way from the icy sleet which
drifted along; ... there she was found dead, and
two babes, which she had brought forth, struggling
in the snow: ... a blanket was thrown over
her, to cover her from sight, ... the only burial
which could be afforded, ... and the infants were
given in charge to a woman who came up in one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_513">513</span>
of the bullock-carts, ... to take their chance for
surviving through such a journey.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Treasure abandoned.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>While the reserve were on this part of the
road, they met between thirty and forty waggons
filled with arms, ammunition, shoes, and clothing,
from England, for Romana’s army. There was
no means of carrying them back; ... such things
as could be made use of were distributed to the
soldiers as they passed, and the rest were destroyed.
Indeed, the baggage which was with
the army could not be carried on: nearly an
hundred waggons, laden with shoes and clothes,
were abandoned upon this ascent. The dollars,
too, could no longer be dragged along: had the
resolution of sacrificing them been determined
upon in time, they might have been distributed
among the men: in this manner, great part
might have been saved from the enemy, and
they who escaped would have had some little
compensation for the hardships which they had
undergone: ... they were now cast over the side
of the precipice, in hopes that the snow might
conceal them from the French: ... many men are
supposed to have been lost, in consequence of
having dropped behind, for the hope of recovering
some of this money. Dreadful as this march
appeared to those who beheld the wreck of the
army strewing its line of road, it was perhaps
still more so for them who performed it in a night
stormy and dark, wading through sludge and
snow, stumbling over the bodies of beasts and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_514">514</span>
men, and hearing, whenever the wind abated,
the groans of those whose sufferings were not yet
terminated by death.</p>

<p>From the summit of this mountain to Lugo is
nearly twelve leagues. There are several bridges
upon the way, over glens and gills, which might
have impeded the pursuit, had they been destroyed.
One, in particular, between Nogales
and Marillas, is the most remarkable work of
art between Coruña and Madrid. This bridge,
which is called Puente del Corzul, crosses a
deep ravine: from its exceeding height, the
narrowness of its lofty arches, and its form,
which, as usual with the Spanish bridges, is
straight, it might at a little distance be mistaken
for an aqueduct. Several of those officers
who knew the road relied much upon the
strength of the ravine, and the impossibility
that the French could bring their guns over,
if the bridge were destroyed. Grievous as it
was to think of destroying so grand a work, its
destruction was attempted; but, as in most
other instances, to no purpose; whether the
pioneers performed their office too hastily, or
because their implements had been abandoned
upon the way.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The army collects at Lugo.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The different divisions had been ordered to
halt and collect at Lugo. Sir John Moore was
now sensible of the impossibility of reaching
Vigo, ... the distance was double that to Coruña,
the road was said to be impracticable for artillery,
and the place itself offered no advantages<span class="pagenum" id="Page_515">515</span>
for embarking in the face of an enemy.
The brigades, however, of Generals Craufurd
and Alton had marched for that port; and General
Fraser, with his division, had been ordered
to follow and join them. A dispatch was sent
to stop him: the dragoon who was entrusted
with it got drunk on the way, and lost the letter;
and these troops, in consequence, had proceeded
a full day’s journey on their way towards Vigo
before the counter-order reached them, and they
were marched back. Thus, instead of having
two days’ rest at Lugo, as had been designed,
they returned to that place excessively harassed,
and with some diminution of number, occasioned
by fatigue. When the horses entered Lugo,
many of them fell dead in the streets, others
were mercifully shot; ... above four hundred
carcasses were lying in the streets and market
places; ... there were none of the army who
had strength to bury them; the towns-people
were under too painful a suspense to think of
performing work which it seemed hopeless to
begin while the frequent musket-shot indicated
so many fresh slaughters; there therefore the
bodies lay, swelling with the rain, bursting,
putrifying, and poisoning the atmosphere, faster
than the glutted dogs and carrion birds could do
their office. Here the retreating army might
have rested, had the destruction of the bridges
been effected; but this attempt had been so imperfectly
executed, that the French came in
sight on the 5th, and, collecting in considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_516">516</span>
strength, took up a good position opposite our
rear-guard, a valley dividing them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John offers battle at Lugo.
<br /><hr />
<span class="date">Jan. 6.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>On the following day they attacked the outposts,
opening upon them with two Spanish pieces
of ordnance, which they had taken on their march.
The attack was made with great spirit; but it was
received, says an officer, “with a steadiness which
excited even our own wonder;” ... for at the sight
of the enemy, and the sound of battle, the English
recovered heart, and derived from their
characteristic and invincible courage a strength

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 7.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

which soon made them victorious. On the 7th
another attack was made, and in like manner
repelled. The prisoners reported that Marshal
Soult was come up with three divisions. Sir John
Moore, therefore, expecting a more formidable
attempt, drew up his whole force on the morning

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 8.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

of the 8th. It was his wish now to bring the
enemy to action; he had perfect confidence in
the valour of the troops, and perceived, also,
that, unless he crippled his pursuers, there was
no hope of embarking unmolested. Order and
discipline were instantaneously restored by this
resolution to fight, and the men seemed at once
to have recovered from their sufferings. The
French were not equally eager for battle; the
trial which they had made of their enemies on
the two preceding days was not such as to encourage
them; and Soult was waiting for more
troops to come up. The country was intersected
with inclosures, and his position was thought too
strong to be attacked by an inferior force. But,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_517">517</span>
in reality, the French at this time were less
numerous than the English. Another reason
assigned for not attacking the enemy was, that
the commissariat had only provisions for two
days: delay, therefore, was judged as disadvantageous
as retreat. It was afterwards known,
that the French expected to be attacked, that
they had no confidence in the strength of their
position, and that their ablest officers apprehended
their advanced guard would have been
cut off. They frequently spoke of this to those
English who were left in their power at Lugo,
and exulted that Sir John Moore had contented
himself with offering battle, instead of forcing
them to an engagement. After waiting till the
afternoon, during a day of snow and storms, Sir
John ordered large fires to be lighted along the
line, for the purpose of deceiving the enemy,
and continued his retreat during the night.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Retreat to Coruña.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Before the reserve left Lugo, the General once
more endeavoured to repress the irregularity of
the march. He warned the soldiers that their
safety depended entirely upon their keeping
their divisions, and marching with their regiments;
and that those who stopped in villages,
or straggled in the way, would inevitably be cut
off by the French cavalry, ... “who have hitherto,”
said he, “shown little mercy even to the feeble
and infirm who have fallen into their hands. The
army has still eleven leagues to march; the soldiers
must make an exertion to accomplish this:
the rear-guard cannot stop; and they who fall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_518">518</span>
behind must take their fate.” These representations
were ineffectual: ... it was, indeed, impossible
to obey them: many of the men were exhausted
and foot-sore, and could not keep their ranks: ...
others, who had totally broke through all discipline,
left them for the love of wine, or for
worse motives. So irresistible was the temptation
of liquor to men in their state, that it was
deemed better to expose them to the cold and
rain of a severe night, than to the wine-houses
of Betanzos, the next town upon their march.
When the Royals reached that place, they only
mustered, with the colours, nine officers, three
serjeants, and three privates: the rest had
dropped on the road; and many of those who
joined did not come up for three days. There
was a memorable instance, in this part of the
retreat, of what might have been accomplished
by discipline and presence of mind. A party
of invalids, between Lugo and Betanzos, were
closely pressed by two squadrons of the enemy’s
cavalry. Serjeant Newman, of the 2d battalion
43d, was among them: he made an effort to pass
three or four hundred of these poor men, then
halted, rallied round him such as were capable
of making any resistance, and directed the
others to proceed as they could. This party he
formed regularly into divisions, and commenced
firing and retiring in an orderly manner, till he
effectually covered the retreat of his disabled
comrades, and made the cavalry give up the
pursuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_519">519</span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Sir John is advised to propose terms.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The partial actions at Lugo, and the risk to
which he had been exposed of a general one,
checked Soult in his pursuit; and he was too
sensible of the danger which he had escaped, to
trust himself again so near the British, without
a superior force. The British army, therefore,
gained twelve hours’ march upon him, and
reached Coruña with little farther molestation;
they obtained implements from Coruña for destroying
the bridge over the Mero, and thus impeded

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 11.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

the enemy’s progress. At Coruña, if the
General had not represented the cause of Spain
as hopeless, they might have found reinforcements
from England, which would have enabled
them to turn upon their pursuers, and take ample
vengeance for the sufferings and the shame which
they had endured. But, instead of reinforcements,
he had directed that empty transports
should be sent; and, for want of due knowledge
of the country, had ordered them to Vigo, instead
of Coruña. That order had been countermanded
as soon as the error was discovered; but
contrary winds detained the ships, ... happily for
the honour of their country, for otherwise the
troops would have quitted Spain as fugitives. It
was apparent now that they could not escape
unless they gained a battle. Coruña was a bad position.
Had they been numerous enough to have
occupied a range of hills about four miles from
the town, they could have defended themselves
against very superior numbers, ... but these heights
required a larger force than the English army, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_520">520</span>
which not less than a fourth part had been
foundered by the way. Both flanks would have
been liable to be turned: it was therefore necessary
to relinquish them to the enemy, and be
content with occupying a second and lower range.
Such, however, were the disadvantages of this situation,
that some of our general officers advised
the Commander to propose terms to Soult, for
permitting the army to embark unmolested. In
communicating this to the Government, Sir John
said he was averse to make any such proposal,
and exceedingly doubtful if it would be attended
with any good effect, ... but whatever he might
resolve upon this head, the Ministers might rest
assured that he would accept no terms which
were in the least dishonourable to the army or
to the country. Happily for his own memory,
upon farther consideration, he rejected the advice.
It is sufficiently disgraceful that such
advice should have been given; and deeply is
England indebted to Sir John Moore for saving
the army from this last and utter ignominy, and
giving it an opportunity of displaying to the
world that courage which had never forsaken
it, and retrieving the honour which, had this
counsel been followed, would irretrievably have
been lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Preparation for battle.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>Arrangements, therefore, were made to give
the enemy battle. One division, under General
Hope, occupied a hill on the left, commanding
the road to Betanzos: the height decreased gradually
to the village of Elvina, taking a curved<span class="pagenum" id="Page_521">521</span>
direction. At this village General Baird’s division
commenced, and bent to the right: the
whole formed nearly a semicircle. On the right
of Sir David Baird, the rifle corps formed a
chain across a valley, and communicated with
General Fraser’s division, which was drawn up
about half a mile from Coruña, near the road
to Vigo. The reserve, under General Paget,
occupied a village on the Betanzos road, about
half a mile in the rear of General Hope. On the
outside of the British posts was a magazine, containing
4000 barrels of gunpowder, which had
been brought from England, and left there, while
the Spanish armies were without ammunition!
It was now necessary to blow it up: ... the explosion
shook the town like an earthquake;
and a village near the magazine was totally
destroyed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>The artillery embarked.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The French made their appearance on the
morning of the 12th, moving in force on the
opposite side of the river Mero. They took up
a position near the village of Perillo, on the left
flank, and occupied the houses along the river.
Their force was continually increasing. On the
14th they commenced a cannonade, which was
returned with such effect, that they at last drew
off their guns. In the evening of this day the
transports from Vigo hove in sight. Some slight
skirmishes took place the following morning.
Preparations meantime were making for the embarkation.
Sir John finding that, from the nature
of the ground, much artillery could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_522">522</span>
employed, placed seven six-pounders and one
howitzer along the line, and kept four Spanish
guns as a reserve, to be advanced to any point
where they might be wanted: the rest of the
artillery was embarked. The sick and the dismounted
cavalry were sent on board with all
possible expedition. A few horses also were
embarked, ... but there was little time for this:
most of them were completely disabled; another
slaughter, therefore, was made of them: and the
beach was covered with their bodies. Some of
these animals, seeing their fellows fall, were sensible
of the fate intended for them: they became
wild with terror, and a few broke loose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><span class="sne">♦</span>Battle of Coruña.<span class="sne">♦</span></div>

<p>The preparations for embarking were completed
on the morning of the 16th, and the General
gave notice, that he intended, if the French
did not move, to begin embarking the reserve at
four in the afternoon. This was about mid-day.
He mounted his horse, and set off to visit the
outposts: before he had proceeded far, a messenger
came to tell him that the enemy’s line were
getting under arms; and a deserter arriving at
the same moment, confirmed the intelligence.
He spurred forward. Their light troops were
pouring rapidly down the hill on the right wing
of the British, and the advanced picquets were
already beginning to fire. Lord William Bentinck’s
brigade, consisting of the 4th, 42d, and
50th regiments, maintained this post. It was a
bad position, and yet, if the troops gave way on
that point, the ruin of the army was inevitable.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_523">523</span>
The guards were in their rear. General Paget
was ordered to advance with the reserve, and
support Lord William. The enemy opened a
cannonade from eleven heavy guns, advantageously
planted on the hills. Two strong columns,
one advancing from a wood, the other skirting
its edge, directed their march towards the right
wing. A third column approached the centre:
a fourth advanced slowly upon the left: a fifth
remained half way down the hill, in the same
direction. Both in number and weight of guns
they had a decided superiority; and they fired
with such effect from the commanding situation
which they had chosen, that the balls in their
bounding reached the British reserve, and occasioned
some loss there.</p>

<p>Sir David Baird had his arm shattered with a
grape-shot as he was leading on his division.
The two lines of infantry advanced against each
other: they were separated by stone walls and
hedges which intersected the ground: but as
they closed, it was perceived that the French line
extended beyond the right flank of the British,
and a body of the enemy was observed moving
up the valley to turn it. Marshal Soult’s intention
was to force the right of the British, and
thus to interpose between Coruña and the army,
and cut it off from the place of embarkation.
Failing in this attempt, he was now endeavouring
to out-flank it. Half of the 4th regiment was
therefore ordered to fall back, forming an obtuse
angle with the other half. This manœuvre was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_524">524</span>
excellently performed, and they commenced a
heavy flanking fire: Sir John Moore called out
to them, that this was exactly what he wanted
to be done, and rode on to the 50th, commanded
by Majors Napier and Stanhope. They got over
an inclosure in their front, charged the enemy
most gallantly, and drove them out of the village
of Elvina; but Major Napier, advancing too far
in the pursuit, received several wounds, and was
made prisoner, and Major Stanhope was<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> killed.</p>

<p>The General now proceeded to the 42d.
“Highlanders,” said he, “remember Egypt!” ...
they rushed on, and drove the French before
them, till they were stopped by a wall: Sir John
accompanied them in this charge. He now sent
Captain Hardinge to order up a battalion of
guards to the left flank of the 42d. The officer
commanding the light infantry conceived, at
this, that they were to be relieved by the guards,
because their ammunition was nearly expended,
and he began to fall back. The General, discovering
the mistake, said to them, “My brave
42d, join your comrades: ammunition is coming,
and you have your bayonets!” Upon this, they
instantly moved forward. Captain Hardinge returned,
and pointed out to the General where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_525">525</span>
the guards were advancing. The enemy kept up
a hot fire, and their artillery played incessantly
on the spot where they were standing. A cannon-shot
struck Sir John, and carried away his left
shoulder, and part of the collar-bone, leaving
the arm hanging by the flesh. He fell from
his horse on his back, his countenance did not
change, neither did he betray the least sensation
of pain. Captain Hardinge, who dismounted, and
took him by the hand, observed him anxiously
watching the 42d, which was warmly engaged,
and told him they were advancing; and upon
that intelligence his countenance brightened.
Colonel Graham, who now came up to assist
him, seeing the composure of his features, began
to hope that he was not wounded, till he perceived
the dreadful laceration. From the size
of the wound, it was in vain to make any attempt
at stopping the blood; and Sir John consented
to be removed in a blanket to the rear.
In raising him up, his sword, hanging on the
wounded side, touched his arm, and became
entangled between his legs: Captain Hardinge
began to unbuckle it; but the General said, in
his usual tone and manner, and in a distinct
voice, “It is as well as it is; I had rather it
should go out of the field with me.” Six soldiers
of the 42d and the guards bore him. Hardinge,
observing his composure, began to hope that the
wound might not be mortal, and said to him,
he trusted he might be spared to the army, and
recover. Moore turned his head, and looking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_526">526</span>
steadfastly at the wound for a few seconds, replied,
“No, Hardinge, I feel that to be impossible.”</p>

<p>As the soldiers were carrying him slowly along,
he made them frequently turn round, that he
might see the field of battle, and listen to the
firing; and he was well pleased when the sound
grew fainter. A spring-waggon came up, bearing
Colonel Wynch, who was wounded; the
Colonel asked who was in the blanket, and being
told it was Sir John Moore, wished him to be
placed in the waggon. Sir John asked one of
the Highlanders whether he thought the waggon
or the blanket was best? and the man said the
blanket would not shake him so much, as he and
the other soldiers would keep the step, and carry
him easy. So they proceeded with him to his
quarters at Coruña, weeping as they went.</p>

<p>General Paget, meantime, hastened with the
reserve to support the right wing. Colonel Beckwith
dashed on with the rifle corps, repelled the
enemy, and advanced so far as nearly to carry
off one of their cannon; but a corps greatly superior
moved up the valley, and forced him to
retire. Paget, however, attacked this body of
the enemy, repulsed it, and pressed on, dispersing
every thing before him, till the enemy, perceiving
their left wing was now quite exposed,
drew it entirely back. The French then advanced
upon Generals Manningham and Leith,
in the centre, and there they were more easily
repelled, the ground being more elevated, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_527">527</span>
favourable for artillery. The position on the left
was strong, and their effort there was unavailing:
but a body of them took possession of a village
on the road to Betanzos, and continued to fire
from it, till Lieutenant-Colonel Nicholls attacked
it, and beat them out. Night was now closing
in, and the French had fallen back in all parts of
the field. The firing, however, was not discontinued
till it was dark.</p>

<p>Never was any battle gained under heavier disadvantages.
The French force exceeded 20,000
men; the British were not 15,000. The superiority
in artillery was equally great: ... the enemy
had met English guns on the way, sent off, thus
late, to the patriotic armies, and these they had
turned back, and employed against the English.
Our artillery was embarked; and the Shrapnell
shells, which contributed so materially to the
success at Vimeiro, were not used in this more
perilous engagement. If the moral and physical
state of the two armies be considered, the disadvantages
under which our soldiers laboured
were still greater: ... the French, equipped in the
stores which they had overtaken upon the road,
elated with a pursuit wherein no man had been
forced beyond his strength, and hourly receiving
reinforcements to their already superior numbers;
... the English, in a state of misery, to which
no army, perhaps, had ever before been reduced
till after a total defeat; having lost their military
chest, their stores, their baggage, their horses,
their women and children, their sick, their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_528">528</span>
wounded, their stragglers, every thing but their
innate, excellent, unconquerable courage. From
6000 to 7000 men had sunk under the fatigues of
their precipitate retreat. The loss in the battle
did not amount to 800; that of the<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>French is
believed to have exceeded 2000. If such a victory
was gained by the British army under such
circumstances, what might not have been achieved
by that army when unbroken, with all its means
at hand, in health and strength, in its pride, and
in its height of hope!</p>

<p>The General lived to hear that the battle was
won. “Are the French beaten?” was the question
which he repeated to every one who came
into his apartment; and he expressed how great
a satisfaction it was to him to know that they
were defeated. “I hope,” he said, “the people
of England will be satisfied! I hope my country
will do me justice.” Then, addressing Colonel
Anderson, who had been his friend and companion
in arms for one-and-twenty years, he said
to him, “Anderson, you know that I have
always wished to die this way.... You will see my
friends as soon as you can: ... tell them every
thing.... Say to my mother”—But here his voice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_529">529</span>
failed, he became excessively agitated, and did
not again venture to name her. Sometimes he
asked to be placed in an easier posture. “I feel
myself so strong,” he said, “I fear I shall be
long dying. It is great uneasiness ... it is great
pain.” But, after a while, he pressed Anderson’s
hand close to his body, and, in a few minutes,
died without a struggle. He fell, as it had ever
been his wish to do, in battle and in victory.
No man was more beloved in private life, nor
was there any general in the British army so universally
respected. All men had thought him
worthy of the chief command. Had he been
less circumspect, had he looked more ardently
forward, and less anxiously around him, and on
all sides, and behind, ... had he been more confident
in himself and in his army, and impressed
with less respect for the French Generals, he
would have been more equal to the difficulties
of his situation. Despondency was the radical
weakness of his mind. Personally he was as
brave a man as ever met death in the field; but
he wanted faith in British courage, and it is faith
by which miracles are wrought in war as well as
in religion. But let it ever be remembered with
gratitude, that, when some of his general officers
advised him to conclude the retreat by a capitulation,
Sir John Moore preserved the honour of
England.</p>

<p>He had often said that, if he were killed in
battle, he wished to be buried where he fell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_530">530</span>
The body was removed at midnight to the citadel
of Coruña. A grave was dug for him on the
rampart there, by a party of the 9th regiment,
the aides-du-camp attending by turns. No coffin
could be procured; and the officers of his staff
wrapped the body, dressed as it was, in a military
cloak and blankets. The interment was
hastened; for, about eight in the morning, some
firing was heard, and they feared that, if a serious
attack were made, they should be ordered away,
and not suffered to pay him their last duty. The
officers of his family bore him to the grave; the
funeral service was read by the chaplain; and
the corpse was covered with earth.</p>

<p>Meantime, General Hope, on whom the command
devolved, passed the night in embarking
the troops. At ten o’clock he ordered them to
march from the field by brigades, leaving strong
picquets to guard the ground, and give notice if
the enemy approached. Major-General Beresford,
with a rear-guard of about 2000 men, to
cover the embarkation, occupied the lines in front
of Coruña. Major-General Hill, with a corps of
reserve, was stationed on a promontory behind
the town. Nearly the whole army was embarked
during the night: the picquets were withdrawn
and embarked also before day, little remaining
ashore at daylight except the rear-guard and the

<span class="sni"><span class="sne">♦</span><span class="date">Jan. 17.</span><span class="sne">♦</span></span>

reserve. The French, seeing this, pushed on
their light troops to the heights of St. Lucia,
which command the harbour, got up some cannon
to a rising ground, and fired at the transports.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_531">531</span>
Several of the masters of these vessels were frightened,
and cut their cables: four of them ran
a-ground. The men were put on board other
ships, and these were burnt. During the night
of the 17th, and the following morning, Beresford
sent off all the sick and wounded who were
in a condition to bear removal: and lastly, the
rear-guard got into the boats, no attempt being
made to interrupt them. Thus terminated our
first campaign in Spain.</p>

The poet goes on describing

whether it be possible that any
person should have survived
them; but that some may be
found wicked enough to inflict
equal tortures under the pretext,
and others conscientious enough
to endure them for the sake
of religion, has been too often
proved, and in few places more
frequently than in Zaragoza itself,
from which city many an
inquisitor has gone to keep company
with Dacianus. St. Engracia

of the circumstances of

There are, however, testimonies
in abundance, and that of M.
Bourgoing will be admitted to
be decisive. “The roof,” he
says, “though very low, is certainly
not smoked. They invite
those who are doubtful of it, to

I saw, or thought I saw, that my

still my doubts, but I took care
to conceal them from my bigoted

tempted to say to them, God has
not thought proper to work any
striking miracle to accelerate the
end of the French revolution, or
to calm the passions which it has

the peaceable inhabitants, encouraged
by these advantages,
hoisted a white flag, and came

Unquestionably, if any traitors

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> General Thiebault says, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">On

</p>
<p>
General Thiebault is certainly
wrong. Had there been any combination
against the common
enemy, the persons by whom it
was concerted would eagerly have
pleaded it afterwards as a claim
to honour if not to reward. The
Portugueze have preserved the
most minute details of a national
insurrection so honourable to the
nation, and the merit of priority
has been contested by different
places: but from all that has been
published it appears, in direct
contradiction to the French general’s
statement, that no combination
existed, (indeed it was
impossible that it should exist,)
and that no tumult broke out on
the day which he has specified as
the commencement of a general
and concerted movement, except
at a village of fishermen in Algarve.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_14" href="#FNanchor_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Baron Thiebault ascribes the
success of the insurgents, and
the loss of Faro, to the news of
Dupont’s surrender, and to the
landing of troops, arms, ammunition,
and money, at Faro, from
the English squadron. Not a man
nor a musket had been landed
from that squadron, and the surrender
of Dupont did not take
place till a month afterwards!
With so little accuracy do the
French relate the circumstances
of their ill success, even where
no military misconduct is imputable.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_15" href="#FNanchor_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Baron Thiebault represents
this as a great exploit on the part
of his fellow-soldiers. He says,
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Le Colonel Maransin auroit pu
éviter Beja, mais il crut devoir
ramener, par un grand exemple,
ce pays à l’obeissance. Il forme
ses colonnes en marchant, et sans
artillerie attaque cette ville, enceinte
de hautes murailles, dont
toutes les portes étoient barricadées,
dont les murs, les tours,
étoient défendus par des forces
quintuples des siennes, et par des
hommes qui, dans leur fureur,
defioient nos bataillons.</i> Who
would suppose, from this description,
that these high walls
and towers were in ruins, and
that they were defended by a
mob of three or four thousand
men, not a third part of whom
were armed with firelocks! After
killing 1200 men in action, and
all who were found in arms after
it, sacking the city, and setting
it on fire, it seems difficult to
understand what the mercy was
which the surviving inhabitants
are said to have sent to Lisbon
to solicit. According to Baron
Thiebault, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un brave religieux</i>,
after the assault, moved all his
auditors to tears, by representing
to them how much they had provoked
their own misfortunes: he
was consequently deputed unanimously
to implore Junot’s clemency.
Junot received him graciously,
and rewarded him with
a canonry; <span class="smcap smaller">LA RECONNOISSANCE
FUT EXTREME</span>, ... <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">et Beja n’en
reprit pas moins les armes peu
de jours après</i>. In the bulletin
published at Lisbon upon this
occasion, and signed by this same
General Thiebault, it is said, the
inhabitants expressed their contrition
by their deputy, acknowledged
that they had been justly
punished, and confessed that they
had been seduced by the English!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_16" href="#FNanchor_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Two persons were left alive
when the French thought their
accursed work was done. One
of them lingered three days before
he was relieved by death.
Feliz Lourenco, the surveyor of
the high road, was the other.
“He,” says Neves, (writing in
1811,) “still lives ... but in what
a condition! With his body and
face disfigured by the marks of
powder, and the scars of eight
and twenty bayonet wounds; ...
with his left eye struck out by
a ball, the bones of his right
shoulder broken, the tendons
rendered useless, and the hand
paralyzed. It is from himself
that I have received the details
of this frightful transaction, of
which there exists no other witness,
except the murderers themselves.”—<i xml:lang="pt" lang="pt">Historia
Geral da Invasam

<i>t.</i> iv. <i>p.</i> 42.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> General Thiebault, by whom
the bulletin was signed, gives a
different statement in his book
(p. 155). The French loss is
there given at sixty men killed,
and from 130 to 140 wounded;
that of the Portugueze as at least
4000 left upon the field.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> As another example of the
arts used to impose upon the
Portugueze people by the intrusive
government, the following
extract from the fifth bulletin
of the army of Portugal may be
read with feelings very different
from what the detail in the text
must excite. “On the 10th of
July forty English disembarked
at the foot of the village of the
Costa, to take in water and provisions.
That point was defended
by only five carabineers of the
thirty-first regiment of light infantry.
Notwithstanding this
disproportion of numbers, these
five men, in sight of all the inhabitants,
attacked the forty English,
repulsed them, forced them
to abandon upon the beach all
that they had purchased, and
pursued them to the sea.” Yet
even this is outdone in the same
bulletin. “Three conscript lads
(it is farther said), of the sixty-sixth
regiment, occupied a small
post on the sea-shore, in front of
Cascaes, when they saw a boat
put off from the English squadron,
and make towards them.
Immediately these three lads
placed themselves in ambush, to
wait till the boat should draw
near: as soon as it reached the
shore they rose from their ambush,
fired upon the boat, killed
the pilot (who was the master of
Admiral Cotton’s ship), obliged
two English officers, and six seamen
or soldiers, who were in the
said boat, to come on shore, and
lay down their arms upon the
beach, and then conducted them
as prisoners of war to the quarters-general
of General Solignac
at Cascaes. This fact discovers
a presence of mind, a degree of
intelligence, and a vigour, which
do honour to the three lads.” To
complete the story, it should have
been added, that the three lads
ate the eight Englishmen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Neves relates that Kellermann
demanded for his own use
50,000 cruzados from the prior
of Alcobaça at this time, letting
him know, without circumlocution,
that what the French generals
wanted was money. He
accepted a hundred moidores after
hard bargaining. Loison heard
of this on his arrival, and, being
on bad terms with Kellermann,
made him refund the money,
charging the prior, if any such
extortion were practised upon
him in future, to complain to
him, wherever he might be. Kellermann,
however, coming there
again when Loison had marched
to the south, redemanded the
money, and laid on ten per cent.
for interest. T. iv. p. 82, 88.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> General Thiebault says, there
was an action at Montemor, in
which the Portugueze lost fifty
men, and that Loison also took
prisoners there some hundred
peasants, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">que les lois de la guerre
condamnoient à la mort, mais qu’il
se borna à desarmer et renvoya
chez eux</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> General Thiebault says, that
after their defeat in the field the
Portugueze wished to capitulate,
but that the Spaniards shot those
persons who by timely submission
would have saved the town:
whereas the fact is, that immediately
after the defeat the Spaniards
made the best of their
way towards their own country.
During the action, he says that
several men dropt down dead,
owing to the excessive heat, the
blood gushing from their ears,
nose, and mouth. He is mistaken
in saying that General
Leite (whom he calls Loti) fell
in this action.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> These facts are notorious in
Portugal, and circumstantial accounts,
too horrible to be repeated,
are published of them.
General Thiebault only says in
his text, that there was a desperate
conflict in the streets, and
that “all who were found in
arms were exterminated.” He
annexes the following note: “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Si
l’on ne put de suite arrêter ces
terribles représailles, si l’on ne
put éviter le pillage de beaucoup
de maisons, les officiers-généraux,
superieurs, et d’état-major,
parvinrent du moins à faire respecter
les églises, où les femmes,
les vieillards, et les habitans paisibles
s’étoient retirés, avec ce qu’ils
avoient de plus précieux; ils firent
plus, ils allèrent rassurer eux-mêmes
tous ceux qui s’y trouvoient,
et dès que l’ordre commença
à se rétablir, ils firent
escorter les femmes jusques chez
elles, afin de les préserver de toute
insulte.</i>” P. 164.
</p>
<p>
That there were some men of
honour and humanity, who protected
the inhabitants as far as
they could, must be believed for
the sake of human nature. But
the Revolution and the school
of Buonaparte had done all that
was possible for eradicating both
humanity and honour; and I
affirm, on the testimony of the
Portugueze, and of those British
officers who have had full opportunities
of ascertaining the
truth, that the conduct of the
French in Evora was marked
with deliberate and sportive
cruelty of the most flagitious
kind. Concerning the conduct
of the general officers, as respects
their sense of honour, I happen
to possess some rather curious
information. Loison promised
the Archbishop that his property
should not be touched.
After this promise, Loison himself,
with some of his officers,
entered the Archbishop’s library,
which was one of the finest in
Portugal; they took down all
the books, in the hope of discovering
valuables behind them,
they broke off the gold and silver
clasps from the magnificent bindings
of the rarest part of the collection,
and in their disappointment
at finding so little plunder,
tore in pieces a whole pile of manuscripts.
They took every gold
and silver coin from his cabinet
of medals, and every jewel and
bit of the precious metals with
which the relics were adorned,
or which decorated any thing in
his oratory. Loison was even
seen in noon-day to take the
Archbishop’s episcopal ring from
the table and pocket it. These circumstances
are stated on the authority
of the Archbishop himself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> Sir Arthur, upon the court of
inquiry, begged leave, in justice
to the individuals composing this
commissariat, to state, that he
did not intend to complain of
want of zeal, nor of any deficiency
of exertion on their
part. “The fact is,” said he,
“that I wished to draw the attention
of the government to this
important branch of the service,
which is but little understood in
this country. The evils of which
I complained are probably to be
attributed to the nature of our
political situation, which prevents
us from undertaking great
military operations, in which the
subsistence of armies becomes a
subject of serious consideration
and difficulty, and these evils
consisted in the inexperience of
almost every individual belonging
to the commissariat, of the
mode of procuring, conveying,
and distributing supplies.” He
requested that this explanation
might stand upon the minutes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> General Thiebault affirms,
that they had only 1900 in the
field. An officer who was dying
of his wounds informed Sir Arthur
Wellesley that their numbers
were 6000. General Thiebault
asserts also, that in a charge
made by General Brenier with
two companies in front of Azambugeira,
the 29th regiment having
lost its colonel, and many of
its officers and men, surrendered
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tout-entier</i>: but that <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par-malheur</i>
the firing did not cease, and the
wreck of the regiment saved itself
by a spontaneous movement,
leaving a major, eight officers,
and fifty men, in the hands of
the French. There is an official
test by which the accuracy of
this statement may be tried; and
thereby it appears, that only four
officers were missing in this
action, and that there was no
major among them. The loss of
the English he states at more
than 2000. The accuracy of our
official lists of the killed and
wounded is among those things
relating to Great Britain which
a Frenchman cannot understand.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> They were cast off cavalry,
purchased in Ireland; and they
were described as old, blind, and
lame: some of them, it was said,
had already at this time died of
age, others of work, though they
had been carefully fed: nearly a
sixth part had thus perished on
the way, and of the remainder
a great number were not worth
the forage which they consumed.
Nine years after these poor horses
had been delivered over to the
dogs and wolves, a representation
was made to me in their favour,
and I feel myself bound to notice
it, were it only for the singularity
of the case. I am assured that the
300 horses (which Lord Castlereagh
good-naturedly called his
countrymen) were selected with
the greatest care, as well as knowledge,
in horseflesh, from 1050 of
which the corps was then composed;
that they were in the very
best condition and working order;
they were drafts from a collection
made by purchase in 1803, (that
is, five years before, and therefore
not young); or from the best
and most useful horses cast
from dragoon regiments, as unfit
for dragoon service generally,
(the inferior description of such
cast horses having been from time
to time sold); that they had been
always carefully groomed and
well fed, and were in excellent
condition for common draft, the
service for which they were required.
From the manner in
which this representation was
made to me, I have no doubt of
its truth. The horses, when they
began the campaign, had probably
not recovered from the voyage;
they were not accustomed to the
food of the country, and were
employed in much harder work
than had ever fallen to their lot
before, and upon much worse
roads. And so, peace to their
memory. I must not however
omit to observe, that Captain
Eliot, in his Treatise on the
Defence of Portugal, says, these
artillery horses, in the brigade to
which he was attached, did their
duty perfectly well at the battle
of Vimeiro.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_26" href="#FNanchor_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> According to General Thiebault,
ten guns and 1800 men;
but to make up the number of
killed and wounded, he adds to
the British loss, what he takes
off from the French, and says,
we had more than 500 killed and
1200 wounded.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> <em>Weel, my bra’ lads, I can

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_28" href="#FNanchor_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> They remained, according to
General Thiebault, long enough
to dress 800 of their wounded
upon the field, and send them
all off for Torres Vedras. The
attitude of the grenadiers with
which General Kellermann had
charged, the rapidity with which
the infantry re-formed, and the
movements of four cavalry regiments
under General Margaron,
he says, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">concoururent efficacement
à contenir l’ennemi. Nous
restames de cette manière, maîtres
du champ de bataille, plus de trois
heures après la cessation de l’action.</i>
It is melancholy to observe,
that the historical relations
of this war which the French
have published since its termination,
are, generally speaking, as
little to be relied on as their official
accounts during its continuance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> General Thiebault, who was
present at this council, represents
the force against them, independent
of Lisbon, of 30,000
British, and 17,000 Spaniards, at
more than 80,000 men, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">auxquels
rien ne manquoit</i>! In reality,
every man in Portugal was their
enemy; but except animosity
and individual courage, the Portugueze
at that time wanted
every thing.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> It is asserted by General
Thiebault, that General Kellermann
was sent to feel his ground,
under pretext of a conference
relating to the prisoners and
wounded. Upon that General’s
return he says, “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">On conçoit de
quel interêt étoient les nouvelles
qu’il rapportoit, et combien elles
parurent heureuses quand on sut à
quel point il avoit réalisé tout ce
qu’on avoit pu esperer. Il avoit</i>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">été reçu avec la plus grande distinction;

l’Anglais, il avoit suivi la
partie la plus mysterieuse de leurs
conversations<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> ; il s’étoit fortifié de
la certitude que, malgré l’énormité
de leurs avantages, les Anglais,
incertains de l’époque de l’arrivée
des renforts, qu’ils attendoient,
n’étoient pas tranquilles sur leur
position: il étoit parvenu à traiter
pour la flotte Russe en même
temps que pour l’armée Française,
et cela en faisant pressenter
que les Russes alloient se joindre
à nous: il étoit arrivé de cette
manière à demander même que
nous émmenassions la flotte Portuguese,
non pour l’obtenir, mais
afin d’avoir quelque chose à céder,
dans le cas où des articles d’une
haute importance seroient trop
contestés; et c’est ainsi, que par
autant d’habilité que de fermeté
et d’adresse, il parvint à conclure
et à signer un traité provisoire.</i>”
This statement is sent into the
world with General Kellermann’s
sanction, Baron Thiebault’s <cite>Relation</cite>
having, as the preface
states, been read to him. General
Kellermann was so successful
in this negotiation, that
he can derive no additional
credit from these additions to
the plain facts. With regard to
the initiative, he came declaredly
to treat for an armistice preparatory
to a convention for evacuating
Portugal, and he produced
a paper containing the
wishes of the French Commander-in-chief;
the deliberations
upon his proposal, which
he is said to have overheard,
were not carried on in his presence,
but in an inner room.
(<cite>Proceedings upon the Inquiry</cite>,
p. 57.) As to the demand
that the French might carry
away the Portugueze fleet, the
French are certainly bold askers;
and in this negotiation, as in
many others, they proved that
Fortune favours the bold; ... but
he must have been more than
bold, who could have made such
a proposal. What was afterwards
asked upon that score will appear
hereafter.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> Llorente, under his name of
Nellerto, (vol. i. 155,) asserts,
that when Florida-Blanca was
summoned to the central Junta
he left a writing, addressed to
the municipality of the city of
Murcia, protesting that he acted
under fear and compulsion, and
in the full knowledge that his
country was going to destruction;
and adding, that he made
this solemn declaration lest King
Joseph should one day treat him
as a criminal. This infamous
calumny, which by its own absurdity
confutes itself, is advanced
by the ex-secretary of
the Inquisition upon no better
authority than that of a Madrid
journal, published under
the Intruder’s government. It
is so palpably calumnious, that
I should not have thought it
worthy of contradiction, if it had
not been doubtfully repeated by
Col. Jones in his very able Account
of the War.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> This part of the bulletin
was officially transmitted by Lord
Castlereagh to Sir John Moore,
with the following instructions:—“His
Majesty cannot overlook
this account, descriptive, according
to the obvious sense of it, of
the murder of some unresisting
stragglers of his army, although
his Majesty is disposed to disbelieve
a transaction, however
sufficiently recorded, which is so
utterly repugnant to the usual
laws of war, and to every principle
of humanity. His Majesty
therefore desires that you will
take the earliest means of ascertaining
the truth of the fact so
recorded, and the circumstances
under which it was perpetrated,
if perpetrated at all. If it shall
upon investigation appear to be
founded, I am to desire you will
cause a protest to be made by you
to the nearest head-quarters of
the French army, and that you
will take such measures as shall
appear to you most expedient for
the protection of the troops under
your orders against conduct so
barbarous and so disgraceful.”—No
such measures were taken, in
consequence of Sir John Moore’s
retreat. This instruction, however,
exculpates the British government
from any charge of indifference
upon the subject.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_40" href="#FNanchor_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> The French historian of
Marshal Soult’s Campaigns in
1808–9, affirms that Sir John
Moore had 37,000 effective men,
and Romana had from 25,000
to 30,000; their united force
amounting thus to more than
60,000!</p></div>

heart, and died so instantaneously,
that the smile with which
he was regarding the conduct of
his men was fixed upon his
cheek. They buried him at the
entrance of the bivouac which
he had occupied the preceding
night; and as his brother leant
forward to look upon the body
for the last time, a rifle-shot
passed through his cloak, and
struck his side; its force was
broken by the folds of the cloak,
otherwise the blow must have
been fatal, and he would have
fallen into the grave upon his
brother’s corpse.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> The historian of Marshal
Soult’s campaigns in 1809 states
the loss of the French at 150
killed and 500 wounded. They
were successful on all points, he
says; the victory was decided,
and if the action had begun earlier,
and if the ground had permitted
the cavalry to charge, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">c’en

These are modest mis-statements
in an author who asserts that, in
the hope of impeding the French
in their pursuit, the English conceived
the horrible intention of
blowing up the town of Betanzos,
where the inhabitants had
received them as allies; and that
for this purpose they deposited
six thousand weight of powder
on the ground floor of the town-house
and set fire to the four
quarters of the town!!</p></div>

<h2 id="Transcribers_Notes" class="nobreak p1">Transcriber’s Notes</h2>

<p>Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; two unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied.</p>

<p>Ambiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences
of inconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.</p>

<p>The source book used many Sidenotes, printed in italics. Most
match entries in the Table of Contents, but some are either dates or
citations. To preserve proximity with the original text, if they were
printed mid-paragraph, that is where they appear here. Depending on the
format in which you are reading this eBook, Sidenotes may be distinguished
from regular text by being shown in some combination of italics,
boldface, UPPER-CASE, enclosed in ♦diamond symbols♦, being offset into
the left-margin, or in a rectangular area within the regular text.
Due to limitations of some eReaders, some sidenotes may appear next
to or below each other, depending on the width of the screen.</p>

<p>In the original book, Sidenote dates at the tops of pages were
enclosed in top- and bottom-borders. In some versions of this eBook,
all Sidenote dates are marked that way, even if they originally were
mid-page.</p>

<p>The original Table of Contents used “ib.” when the page
number was the same as the one in the previous entry. This
eBook uses the actual page numbers.</p>

<p>Possible spelling and accent mark errors in non-English words
have not been changed, but, as with English words, when
there is a predominant spelling for a specific word or name,
it is used in all cases.</p>
